				<p><time datetime="1661-03-11">March 1st</time>. All the morning at the office. Dined at home only upon fish, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley and Tom Hater with me. After dinner <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley and I in private talking about my Lord’s intentions to go speedily into the country, but to what end we know not. We fear he is to go to sea with this fleet now preparing. But we wish that he could get his £4,000 per annum settled before he do go. Then he and I walked into London, he to the Wardrobe and I to Whitefryars, and saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Bondman</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-957" id="noteref-957" epub:type="noteref">957</a> acted; an excellent play and well done. But above all that ever I saw, Betterton<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-958" id="noteref-958" epub:type="noteref">958</a> do the Bond man the best. Then to my father’s and found my mother ill. After staying a while with them, I went home and sat up late, spending my thoughts how to get money to bear me out in my great expense at the Coronacion, against which all provide, and scaffolds setting up in every street. I had many designs in my head to get some, but know not which will take. To bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-12">2nd</time>. Early with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore about Sir Paul Neale’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-959" id="noteref-959" epub:type="noteref">959</a> business with my uncle and other things all the morning. Dined with him at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s, and after dinner I went to the Theatre, where I found so few people (which is strange, and the reason I did not know) that I went out again, and so to Salsbury Court, where the house as full as could be; and it seems it was a new play, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Queen’s Mask</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-960" id="noteref-960" epub:type="noteref">960</a> wherein there are some good humours: among others, a good jeer to the old story of the Siege of Troy, making it to be a common country tale. But above all it was strange to see so little a boy as that was to act Cupid, which is one of the greatest parts in it. Then home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-3-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-03-13">3rd (Lord’s day)</time>. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Woodcocke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-961" id="noteref-961" epub:type="noteref">961</a> preached at our church a very good sermon upon the imaginacions of the thoughts of man’s heart being only evil. So home, where being told that my Lord had sent for me I went, and got there to dine with my Lord, who is to go into the country tomorrow. I did give up the mortgage made to me by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Parkhurst for £2,000. In the Abby all the afternoon. Then at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierces the surgeon, where Shepley and I supped. So to my Lord’s, who comes in late and tells us how news is come today of Mazarin’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-962" id="noteref-962" epub:type="noteref">962</a> being dead, which is very great news and of great consequence. I lay tonight with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley here, because of my Lord’s going tomorrow.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-3-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-03-14">4th</time>. My Lord went this morning on his journey to Hinchingbroke, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parker with him; the chief business being to look over and determine how, and in what manner, his great work of building shall be done. Before his going he did give me some jewells to keep for him, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, that that the King of Sweden did give him, with the King’s own picture in it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-963" id="noteref-963" epub:type="noteref">963</a> most excellently done; and a brave George, all of diamonds, and this with the greatest expressions of love and confidence that I could imagine or hope for, which is a very great joy to me. To the office all the forenoon. Then to dinner and so to Whitehall to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry about several businesses, and then with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, who went with me to drink a cup of ale, and after some good discourse then home and sat late talking with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten. So home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-15">5th</time>. With <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, purser, to Westminster Hall, and there met with Captain Cuttance, <abbr>Lieut.</abbr> Lambert, and Pierce, surgeon, thinking to have met with the Commissioners of Parliament, but they not sitting, we went to the Swan, where I did give them a barrel of oysters; and so I to my Lady’s and there dined, and had very much talk and pleasant discourse with my Lady, my esteem growing every day higher and higher in her and my Lord. So to my father Bowyer’s where my wife was, and to the Commissioners of Parliament, and there did take some course about having my Lord’s salary paid tomorrow when the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i> is paid off, but I was troubled to see how high they carry themselves, when in good truth nobody cares for them. So home by coach and my wife. I then to the office, where Sir Williams both and I set about making an estimate of all the officers’ salaries in ordinary in the Navy till 10 o’clock at night. So home, and I with my head full of thoughts how to get a little present money, I eat a bit of bread and cheese, and so to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-16">6th</time>. At the office all the morning. At dinner Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten came and took me and my wife to his house to dinner, my Lady being in the country, where we had a good Lenten dinner. Then to Whitehall with <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Cuttle, and there I did some business with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and after that home, thinking to have had Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, to have eat a wigg<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-964" id="noteref-964" epub:type="noteref">964</a> at my house at night. But my Lady being come home out of the country ill by reason of much rain that has fallen lately, and the waters being very high, we could not, and so I home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-3-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-03-17">7th</time>. This morning Sir Williams both went to Woolwich to sell some old provisions there. I to Whitehall, and up and down about many businesses. Dined at my Lord’s, then to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, and he and I to London to Guildhall to see the seamen paid off, but could not without trouble, and so I took him to the Fleece tavern, where the pretty woman that Luellin lately told me the story of dwells, but I could not see her. Then towards home and met Spicer, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Vines, Ruddiard, and a company more of my old acquaintance, and went into a place to drink some ale, and there we stayed playing the fool till late, and so I home. At home met with ill news that my hopes of getting some money for the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i> were spoiled through <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waith’s perverseness, which did so vex me that I could not sleep at night. But I wrote a letter to him to send tomorrow morning for him to take my money for me, and so with good words I thought to coy with him. To bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-3-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-03-18">8th</time>. All the morning at the office. At noon Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, <abbr>Col.</abbr> Slingsby and I by coach to the Tower, to Sir John Robinson’s, to dinner; where great good cheer. High company; among others the Duchess of Albemarle, who is ever a plain homely dowdy. After dinner, to drink all the afternoon. Towards night the Duchess and ladies went away. Then we set to it again till it was very late. And at last came in Sir William Wale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-965" id="noteref-965" epub:type="noteref">965</a> almost fuddled; and because I was set between him and another, only to keep them from talking and spoiling the company (as we did to others), he fell out with the Lieutenant of the Tower; but with much ado we made him understand his error, and then all quiet. And so he carried Sir William Batten and I home again in his coach, and so I almost overcome with drink went to bed. I was much contented to ride in such state into the Tower, and be received among such high company, while <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mount, my Lady Duchess’s gentleman usher, stood waiting at table, whom I ever thought a man so much above me in all respects; also to hear the discourse of so many high Cavaliers of things past. It was a great content and joy to me.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-3-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-03-19">9th</time>. To Whitehall and there with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed took a most pleasant walk for two hours in the park, which is now a very fair place. Here we had a long and candid discourse one to another of one another’s condition, and he giving me an occasion I told him of my intention to get £60 paid me by him for a gratuity for my labour extraordinary at sea. Which he did not seem unwilling to, and therefore I am very glad it is out. To my Lord’s, where we found him lately come from Hinchingbroke, where he left my uncle very well, but my aunt not likely to live. I stayed and dined with him. He took me aside, and asked me what the world spoke of the King’s marriage. Which I answering as one that knew nothing, he enquired no further of me. But I do perceive by it that there is something in it that is ready to come out that the world knows not of yet. After dinner into London to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s and my father’s, made visits and then home, where I sat late making of my journal for four days past, and so to bed.</p>

In the afternoon again to church, and there heard one Castle, whom I knew of my year at Cambridge. He made a dull sermon. After sermon came my uncle and aunt Wight to see us, and we sat together a great while. Then to reading and at night to bed.</p>

At night home and found my wife come home, and among other things she hath got her teeth new done by La Roche, and are indeed now pretty handsome, and I was much pleased with it. So to bed.</p>

So home, where I found <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt in great trouble about her husband’s losing of his place in the Excise. From thence to Guildhall, and there set my hand to the book before Colonel King for my sea pay, and blessed be God! they have cast me at midshipman’s pay, which do make my heart very glad.

Then to my Lord’s, and so with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed to an alehouse, where he told me a long story of his amours at Portsmouth to one of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Boat’s daughters, which was very pleasant.

At the office all the morning, dined at home and with my wife to Westminster, where I had business with the Commissioner for paying the seamen about my Lord’s pay, and my wife at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt’s. I called her home, and made inquiry at Greatorex’s and in other places to hear of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlow (thinking to hear that he is dead), but I cannot find it so, but the contrary. Home and called at my Lady Batten’s, and supped there, and so home. This day an ambassador from Florence was brought into the town in state. Good hopes given me today that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davis is going away from us, her husband going shortly to Ireland. Yesterday it was said was to be the day that the Princess Henrietta was to marry the Duke d’Anjou<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-971" id="noteref-971" epub:type="noteref">971</a> in France. This day I found in the news-booke that Roger Pepys is chosen at Cambridge for the town, the first place that we hear of to have made their choice yet. To bed with my head and mind full of business, which do a little put me out of order, and I do find myself to become more and more thoughtful about getting of money than ever heretofore.</p>

At the office all the morning, dined at home and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley with me, and after dinner we did a good deal of business in my study about my Lord’s accounts to be made up and presented to our office.

The great talk of the town is the strange election that the City of London made yesterday for Parliament-men; <abbr>viz.</abbr> Fowke, Love, Jones, and⁠ ⁠… ,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-973" id="noteref-973" epub:type="noteref">973</a> men that are so far from being episcopall that they are thought to be Anabaptists; and chosen with a great deal of zeal, in spite of the other party that thought themselves very strong, calling out in the Hall, “No Bishops! no Lord Bishops!” It do make people to fear it may come to worse, by being an example to the country to do the same. And indeed the Bishops are so high, that very few do love them.</p>

Then I by water (<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley, Pinkney, and others going part of the way) home, and then hard at work setting my papers in order, and writing letters till night, and so to bed. This day I saw the Florence Ambassador go to his audience, the weather very foul, and yet he and his company very gallant.

The day very pleasant, though the way bad.

At last came back again and went in, where I was led by a seaman that knew me, but is here as a servant, up to the tiring-room, where strange the confusion and disorder that there is among them in fitting themselves, especially here, where the clothes are very poor, and the actors but common fellows. At last into the Pitt, where I think there was not above ten more than myself, and not one hundred in the whole house. And the play, which is called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">All’s Lost by Lust</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-975" id="noteref-975" epub:type="noteref">975</a> poorly done; and with so much disorder, among others, that in the music-room the boy that was to sing a song, not singing it right, his master fell about his ears and beat him so, that it put the whole house in an uprore. Thence homewards, and at the Mitre met my uncle Wight, and with him <abbr>Lieut.</abbr>-<abbr>Col.</abbr> Baron,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-976" id="noteref-976" epub:type="noteref">976</a> who told us how Crofton,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-977" id="noteref-977" epub:type="noteref">977</a> the great Presbyterian minister that had lately preached so highly against Bishops, is clapped up this day into the Tower.

To the office, and there all the morning, dined at home, and after dinner comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Salisbury to see me, and showed me a face or two of his paynting, and indeed I perceive that he will be a great master. I took him to Whitehall with me by water, but he would not by any means be moved to go through bridge, and so we were fain to go round by the Old Swan. To my Lord’s and there I showed him the King’s picture, which he intends to copy out in little. After that I and Captain Ferrers to Salisbury Court by water, and saw part of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Queen’s Mask</i>. Then I to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and there stayed talking late. <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">The.</abbr> Turner being in a great chafe, about being disappointed of a room to stand in at the Coronacion. Then to my father’s, and there stayed talking with my mother and him late about my dinner tomorrow. So homewards and took up a boy that had a lantern, that was picking up of rags, and got him to light me home, and had great discourse with him how he could get sometimes three or four bushells of rags in a day, and got 3<abbr>d.</abbr> a bushell for them, and many other discourses, what and how many ways there are for poor children to get their livings honestly. So home and I to bed at 12 o’clock at night, being pleased well with the work that my workmen have begun today.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-04-05">26th</time>. Up early to do business in my study. This is my great day that three years ago I was cut of the stone, and, blessed be God, I do yet find myself very free from pain again. All this morning I stayed at home looking after my workmen to my great content about my stairs, and at noon by coach to my father’s, where <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">The.</abbr> Joyce, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Morrice, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Armiger, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, the surgeon, and his wife, my father and mother, and myself and my wife. Very merry at dinner; among other things, because <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner and her company eat no flesh at all this Lent, and I had a great deal of good flesh which made their mouths water. After dinner <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce and her husband and I and my wife to Salisbury Court, where coming late he and she light of <abbr>Col.</abbr> Boone that made room for them, and I and my wife sat in the pit, and there met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lewes and Tom Whitton, and saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Bondman</i> done to admiration. So home by coach, and after a view of what the workmen had done today I went to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-04-06">27th</time>. Up early to see my workmen at work. My brother Tom comes to me, and among other things I looked over my old clothes and did give him a suit of black stuff clothes and a hat and some shoes. At the office all the morning, where Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret comes, and there I did get him to promise me some money upon a bill of exchange, whereby I shall secure myself of £60 which otherwise I should not know how to get. At noon I found my stairs quite broke down, that I could not get up but by a ladder; and my wife not being well she kept her chamber all this day. To the Dolphin to a dinner of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harris’s, where Sir Williams both and my Lady Batten, and her two daughters, and other company, where a great deal of mirth, and there stayed till 11 o’clock at night; and in our mirth I sang and sometimes fiddled (there being a noise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-978" id="noteref-978" epub:type="noteref">978</a> of fiddlers there), and at last we fell to dancing, the first time that ever I did in my life, which I did wonder to see myself to do. At last we made Mingo, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s black, and Jack, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s, dance, and it was strange how the first did dance with a great deal of seeming skill. Home, where I found my wife all day in her chamber. So to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-04-07">28th</time>. Up early among my workmen, then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed coming to see me I went along with him to Sir Robert Slingsby (he being newly maister of that title by being made a Baronett) to discourse about <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed’s accounts to be made up, and from thence by coach to my cousin Thomas Pepys, to borrow £1,000 for my Lord, which I am to expect an answer to tomorrow. So to my Lord’s, and there stayed and dined, and after dinner did get my Lord to view <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley’s accounts as I had examined them, and also to sign me a bond for my £500. Then with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley to the Theatre and saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Rollo</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-979" id="noteref-979" epub:type="noteref">979</a> ill acted. That done to drink a cup of ale and so by coach to London, and having set him down in Cheapside I went home, where I found a great deal of work done today, and also £70 paid me by the Treasurer upon the bill of exchange that I have had hopes of so long, so that, my heart in great content; I went to bed.</p>

Then to the office, where I found Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn sent down yesterday to Chatham to get two great ships in readiness presently to go to the East Indies upon some design against the Dutch, we think, at Goa<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-980" id="noteref-980" epub:type="noteref">980</a> but it is a great secret yet. Dined at home, came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley and Moore, and did business with both of them. After that to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, where great store of company at dinner.

Then home and there put some papers in order, and not knowing what to do, the house being so dirty, I went to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-04-10">31st (Sunday)</time>. At church, where a stranger preached like a fool. From thence home and dined with my wife, she staying at home, being unwilling to dress herself, the house being all dirty.
