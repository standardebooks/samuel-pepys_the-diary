				<p>1660⁠–⁠61. At the end of the last and the beginning of this year, I do live in one of the houses belonging to the Navy Office, as one of the principal officers, and have done now about half a year. After much trouble with workmen I am now almost settled; my family being, myself, my wife, Jane, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Will.</abbr> Hewer, and Wayneman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-855" id="noteref-855" epub:type="noteref">855</a> my girle’s brother. Myself in constant good health, and in a most handsome and thriving condition. Blessed be Almighty God for it. I am now taking of my sister to come and live with me. As to things of State.⁠—The King settled, and loved of all. The Duke of York matched to my Lord Chancellor’s daughter, which do not please many. The Queen upon her return to France with the Princess Henrietta. The Princess of Orange<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-856" id="noteref-856" epub:type="noteref">856</a> lately dead, and we into new mourning for her. We have been lately frighted with a great plot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-857" id="noteref-857" epub:type="noteref">857</a> and many taken up on it, and the fright not quite over. The Parliament, which had done all this great good to the King, beginning to grow factious, the King did dissolve it December 29th last, and another likely to be chosen speedily. I take myself now to be worth £300 clear in money, and all my goods and all manner of debts paid, which are none at all.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-01-11">January 1st</time>. Called up this morning by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, who brought me my last things for me to sign for the last month, and to my great comfort tells me that my fees will come to £80 clear to myself, and about £25 for him, which he hath got out of the pardons, though there be no fee due to me at all out of them. Then comes in my brother Thomas, and after him my father, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Thomas Pepys, my uncle Fenner and his two sons (Anthony’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-858" id="noteref-858" epub:type="noteref">858</a> only child dying this morning, yet he was so civil to come, and was pretty merry) to breakfast; and I had for them a barrel of oysters, a dish of neat’s tongues, and a dish of anchovies, wine of all sorts, and Northdown ale. We were very merry till about eleven o’clock, and then they went away. At noon I carried my wife by coach to my cousin, Thomas Pepys, where we, with my father, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Thomas, cousin Stradwick, Scott, and their wives, dined. Here I saw first his second wife, which is a very respectful woman, but his dinner a sorry, poor dinner for a man of his estate, there being nothing but ordinary meat in it. Today the King dined at a lord’s, two doors from us. After dinner I took my wife to Whitehall, I sent her to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s (where we should have dined today), and I to the Privy Seal, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore took out all his money, and he and I went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierces; in our way seeing the Duke of York bring his Lady this day to wait upon the Queen, the first time that ever she did since that great business; and the Queen is said to receive her now with much respect and love; and there he cast up the fees, and I told the money, by the same token one £100 bag, after I had told it, fell all about the room, and I fear I have lost some of it. That done I left my friends and went to my Lord’s, but he being not come in I lodged the money with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley, and bade good night to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, and so returned to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierces, and there supped with them, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, the purser, and his wife and mine, where we had a calf’s head carboned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-859" id="noteref-859" epub:type="noteref">859</a> but it was raw, we could not eat it, and a good hen. But she is such a slut that I do not love her victualls. After supper I sent them home by coach, and I went to my Lord’s and there played till 12 at night at cards at Best with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Goods and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">N.</abbr> Osgood, and then to bed with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-12" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-12">2nd</time>. Up early, and being called up to my Lord he did give me many commands in his business. As about taking care to write to my uncle that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barnewell’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-860" id="noteref-860" epub:type="noteref">860</a> papers should be locked up, in case he should die, he being now suspected to be very ill. Also about consulting with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Montagu for the settling of the £4,000 a-year that the King had promised my Lord. As also about getting of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George Montagu to be chosen at Huntingdon this next Parliament, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> That done he to Whitehall Stairs with much company, and I with him; where we took water for Lambeth, and there coach for Portsmouth. The Queen’s things were all in Whitehall Court ready to be sent away, and her Majesty ready to be gone an hour after to Hampton Court tonight, and so to be at Portsmouth on Saturday next. I by water to my office, and there all the morning, and so home to dinner, where I found Pall (my sister) was come; but I do not let her sit down at table with me, which I do at first that she may not expect it hereafter from me. After dinner I to Westminster by water, and there found my brother Spicer at the Leg with all the rest of the Exchequer men (most of whom I now do not know) at dinner. Here I stayed and drank with them, and then to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George Montagu about the business of election, and he did give me a piece in gold; so to my Lord’s and got the chest of plate brought to the Exchequer, and my brother Spicer put it into his treasury. So to Will’s with them to a pot of ale, and so parted. I took a turn in the Hall, and bought the King and Chancellor’s speeches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-861" id="noteref-861" epub:type="noteref">861</a> at the dissolving the Parliament last Saturday. So to my Lord’s, and took my money I brought thither last night and the silver candlesticks, and by coach left the latter at Alderman Backwell’s, I having no use for them, and the former home. There stood a man at our door, when I carried it in, and saw me, which made me a little afeard. Up to my chamber and wrote letters to Huntingdon and did other business. This day I lent Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Rider my chine of beef for to serve at dinner tomorrow at Trinity House, the Duke of Albemarle being to be there and all the rest of the Brethren, it being a great day for the reading over of their new Charter, which the King hath newly given them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-862" id="noteref-862" epub:type="noteref">862</a></p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-13">3rd</time>. Early in the morning to the Exchequer, where I told over what money I had of my Lord’s and my own there, which I found to be £970. Thence to Will’s, where Spicer and I eat our dinner of a roasted leg of pork which Will did give us, and after that to the Theatre, where was acted <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Beggars’ Bush</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-863" id="noteref-863" epub:type="noteref">863</a> it being very well done; and here the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-864" id="noteref-864" epub:type="noteref">864</a> From thence to my father’s, where I found my mother gone by Bird, the carrier, to Brampton, upon my uncle’s great desire, my aunt being now in despair of life. So home.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-14">4th</time>. Office all the morning, my wife and Pall being gone to my father’s to dress dinner for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Honiwood, my mother being gone out of town. Dined at home, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore with me, with whom I had been early this morning at Whitehall, at the Jewell Office,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-865" id="noteref-865" epub:type="noteref">865</a> to choose a piece of gilt plate for my Lord, in return of his offering to the King (which it seems is usual at this time of year, and an Earl gives twenty pieces in gold in a purse to the King). I chose a gilt tankard, weighing 31 ounces and a half, and he is allowed 30; so I paid 12<abbr>s.</abbr> for the ounce and half over what he is to have; but strange it was for me to see what a company of small fees I was called upon by a great many to pay there, which, I perceive, is the manner that courtiers do get their estates. After dinner <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore and I to the Theatre, where was <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Scornful Lady</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-866" id="noteref-866" epub:type="noteref">866</a> acted very well, it being the first play that ever he saw. Thence with him to drink a cup of ale at Hercules Pillars, and so parted. I called to see my father, who told me by the way how Will and Mary Joyce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-867" id="noteref-867" epub:type="noteref">867</a> do live a strange life together, nothing but fighting, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, so that sometimes her father has a mind to have them divorced. Thence home.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1661-1-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-15">5th</time>. Home all the morning. Several people came to me about business, among others the great Tom Fuller, who came to desire a kindness for a friend of his,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-868" id="noteref-868" epub:type="noteref">868</a> who hath a mind to go to Jamaica with these two ships that are going, which I promised to do. So to Whitehall to my Lady, whom I found at dinner and dined with her, and stayed with her talking all the afternoon, and thence walked to Westminster Hall. So to Will’s, and drank with Spicer, and thence by coach home, staying a little in Paul’s Churchyard, to bespeak Ogilby’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Aesop’s Fables</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-869" id="noteref-869" epub:type="noteref">869</a> and Tully’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Offices</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-870" id="noteref-870" epub:type="noteref">870</a> to be bound for me.

			<article id="entry-1661-1-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-16">6th (Lord’s day)</time>. My wife and I to church this morning, and so home to dinner to a boiled leg of mutton all alone. To church again, where, before sermon, a long Psalm was set that lasted an hour, while the sexton gathered his year’s contribucion through the whole church. After sermon home, and there I went to my chamber and wrote a letter to send to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, with a piece of plate along with it, which I do preserve among my other letters. So to supper, and thence after prayers to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-17">7th</time>. This morning, news was brought to me to my bedside, that there had been a great stir in the City this night by the Fanatics, who had been up and killed six or seven men, but all are fled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-871" id="noteref-871" epub:type="noteref">871</a> My Lord Mayor and the whole City had been in arms, above 40,000. To the office, and after that to dinner, where my brother Tom came and dined with me, and after dinner (leaving 12<abbr>d.</abbr> with the servants to buy a cake with at night, this day being kept as Twelfth day) Tom and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Silent Woman</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-872" id="noteref-872" epub:type="noteref">872</a> The first time that ever I did see it, and it is an excellent play. Among other things here, Kinaston, the boy; had the good turn to appear in three shapes: first, as a poor woman in ordinary clothes, to please Morose; then in fine clothes, as a gallant, and in them was clearly the prettiest woman in the whole house, and lastly, as a man; and then likewise did appear the handsomest man in the house. From thence by link to my cousin Stradwick’s, where my father and we and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pepys, Scott, and his wife, and one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ward and his; and after a good supper, we had an excellent cake, where the mark for the Queen was cut, and so there was two queens, my wife and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ward; and the King being lost, they chose the Doctor to be King, so we made him send for some wine, and then home, and in our way home we were in many places strictly examined, more than in the worst of times, there being great fears of these Fanatics rising again: for the present I do not hear that any of them are taken. Home, it being a clear moonshine and after 12 o’clock at night. Being come home we found that my people had been very merry, and my wife tells me afterwards that she had heard that they had got young Davis and some other neighbours with them to be merry, but no harm.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-18">8th</time>. My wife and I lay very long in bed today talking and pleasing one another in discourse. Being up, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Warren came, and he and I agreed for the deals that my Lord is to, have. Then Will and I to Westminster, where I dined with my Lady. After dinner I took my Lord Hinchinbroke and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sidney to the Theatre, and showed them <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Widdow</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-873" id="noteref-873" epub:type="noteref">873</a> an indifferent good play, but wronged by the women being to seek in their parts. That being done, my Lord’s coach waited for us, and so back to my Lady’s, where she made me drink of some Florence wine, and did give me two bottles for my wife. From thence walked to my cousin Stradwick’s, and there chose a small banquet and some other things against our entertainment on Thursday next. Thence to Tom Pepys and bought a dozen of trenchers, and so home. Some talk today of a head of Fanatics that do appear about Barnett, but I do not believe it. However, my Lord Mayor, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Richd.</abbr> Browne, hath carried himself very honourably, and hath caused one of their meetinghouses in London to be pulled down.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1661-1-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-19">9th</time>. Waked in the morning about six o’clock, by people running up and down in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis’s house, talking that the Fanatics were up in arms in the City. And so I rose and went forth; where in the street I found everybody in arms at the doors. So I returned (though with no good courage at all, but that I might not seem to be afeared), and got my sword and pistol, which, however, I had no powder to charge; and went to the door, where I found Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford, and with him I walked up and down as far as the Exchange, and there I left him. In our way, the streets full of Trainband, and great stories, what mischief these rogues have done; and I think near a dozen have been killed this morning on both sides. Seeing the city in this condition, the shops shut, and all things in trouble, I went home and sat, it being office day, till noon. So home, and dined at home, my father with me, and after dinner he would needs have me go to my uncle Wight’s (where I have been so long absent that I am ashamed to go). I found him at home and his wife, and I can see they have taken my absence ill, but all things are past and we good friends, and here I sat with my aunt till it was late, my uncle going forth about business. My aunt being very fearful to be alone. So home to my lute till late, and then to bed, there being strict guards all night in the City, though most of the enemies, they say, are killed or taken.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-874" id="noteref-874" epub:type="noteref">874</a> This morning my wife and Pall went forth early, and I stayed within.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-20">10th</time>. There comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hawley to me and brings me my money for the quarter of a year’s salary of my place under Downing that I was at sea. So I did give him half, whereof he did in his nobleness give the odd 5<abbr>s.</abbr> to my Jane. So we both went forth (calling first to see how Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn do, whom I found very ill), and at the Hoop by the bridge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-875" id="noteref-875" epub:type="noteref">875</a> we drank two pints of wormwood and sack. Talking of his wooing afresh of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lane, and of his going to serve the Bishop of London. Thence by water to Whitehall, and found my wife at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt’s. Leaving her to dine there, I went and dined with my Lady, and stayed to talk a while with her. After dinner <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Will.</abbr> comes to tell me that he had presented my piece of plate to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, who takes it very kindly, and sends me a very kind letter, and the plate back again; of which my heart is very glad. So to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt, where I found a Frenchman, a lodger of hers, at dinner, and just as I came in was kissing my wife, which I did not like, though there could not be any hurt in it. Thence by coach to my Uncle Wight’s with my wife, but they being out of doors we went home, where, after I had put some papers in order and entered some letters in my book which I have a mind to keep, I went with my wife to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it. Here we sat a great while, at last comes in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis and his lady (who takes it very ill that my wife never did go to see her), and so we fell to talk. Among other things <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis told us the particular examinations of these Fanatics that are taken: and in short it is this, of all these Fanatics that have done all this, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, routed all the Trainbands that they met with, put the King’s life-guards to the run, killed about twenty men, broke through the City gates twice; and all this in the daytime, when all the City was in arms; are not in all about 31. Whereas we did believe them (because they were seen up and down in every place almost in the City, and had been about Highgate two or three days,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-876" id="noteref-876" epub:type="noteref">876</a> and in several other places) to be at least 500. A thing that never was heard of, that so few men should dare and do so much mischief. Their word was, “The King Jesus, and the heads upon the gates.” Few of them would receive any quarter, but such as were taken by force and kept alive; expecting Jesus to come here and reign in the world presently, and will not believe yet but their work will be carried on though they do die. The King this day came to town.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-21" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-21">11th</time>. Office day. This day comes news, by letters from Portsmouth, that the Princess Henrietta is fallen sick of the meazles on board the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">London</i>, after the Queen and she was under sail. And so was forced to come back again into Portsmouth harbour; and in their way, by negligence of the pilot, run upon the Horse sand. The Queen and she continue aboard, and do not intend to come on shore till she sees what will become of the young Princess. This news do make people think something indeed, that three of the Royal Family should fall sick of the same disease, one after another. This morning likewise, we had order to see guards set in all the King’s yards; and so we do appoint who and who should go to them. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Batten to Chatham, Colonel Slingsby and I to Deptford and Woolwich. Portsmouth being a garrison, needs none. Dined at home, discontented that my wife do not go neater now she has two maids. After dinner comes in Kate Sterpin (whom we had not seen a great while) and her husband to see us, with whom I stayed a while, and then to the office, and left them with my wife. At night walked to Paul’s Churchyard, and bespoke some books against next week, and from thence to the Coffeehouse, where I met Captain Morrice, the upholster, who would fain have lent me a horse tonight to have rid with him upon the Cityguards, with the Lord Mayor, there being some new expectations of these rogues; but I refused by reason of my going out of town tomorrow. So home to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-22">12th</time>. With Colonel Slingsby and a friend of his, Major Waters (a deaf and most amorous melancholy gentleman, who is under a despayr in love, as the Colonel told me, which makes him bad company, though a most good-natured man), by water to Redriffe, and so on foot to Deptford (our servants by water), where we fell to choosing four captains to command the guards, and choosing the places where to keep them, and other things in order thereunto. We dined at the Globe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-877" id="noteref-877" epub:type="noteref">877</a> having our messenger with us to take care for us. Never till now did I see the great authority of my place, all the captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us. Having stayed very late there talking with the Colonel, I went home with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis, storekeeper (whose wife is ill and so I could not see her), and was there most prince-like lodged, with so much respect and honour that I was at a loss how to behave myself.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-23" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-23">13th</time>. In the morning we all went to church, and sat in the pew belonging to us, where a cold sermon of a young man that never had preached before. Here Commissioner came with his wife and daughters, the eldest being his wife’s daughter is a very comely black woman.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-878" id="noteref-878" epub:type="noteref">878</a> So to the Globe to dinner, and then with Commissioner Pett to his lodgings there (which he hath for the present while he is building the King’s yacht, which will be a pretty thing, and much beyond the Dutchman’s), and from thence with him and his wife and daughter-in-law by coach to Greenwich Church, where a good sermon, a fine church, and a great company of handsome women. After sermon to Deptford again; where, at the Commissioner’s and the Globe, we stayed long. And so I to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis’s to bed again. But no sooner in bed, but we had an alarm, and so we rose: and the Comptroller comes into the Yard to us; and seamen of all the ships present repair to us, and there we armed with every one a handspike, with which they were as fierce as could be. At last we hear that it was only five or six men that did ride through the guard in the town, without stopping to the guard that was there; and, some say, shot at them. But all being quiet there, we caused the seamen to go on board again. And so we all to bed (after I had sat awhile with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis in his study, which is filled with good books and some very good song books) I likewise to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-24" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-24">14th</time>. The arms being come this morning from the Tower, we caused them to be distributed. I spent much time walking with Lieutenant Lambert, walking up and down the yards, who did give me much light into things there, and so went along with me and dined with us. After dinner <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pett, her husband being gone this morning with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten to Chatham, lent us her coach, and carried us to Woolwich, where we did also dispose of the arms there and settle the guards. So to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pett’s, the shipwright, and there supped, where he did treat us very handsomely (and strange it is to see what neat houses all the officers of the King’s yards have), his wife a proper woman, and has been handsome, and yet has a very pretty hand. Thence I with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ackworth to his house, where he has a very pretty house, and a very proper lovely woman to his wife, who both sat with me in my chamber, and they being gone, I went to bed, which was also most neat and fine.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-1-25" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-01-25">15th</time>. Up and down the yard all the morning and seeing the seamen exercise, which they do already very handsomely. Then to dinner at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ackworth’s, where there also dined with us one Captain Bethell, a friend of the Comptroller’s.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-879" id="noteref-879" epub:type="noteref">879</a> A good dinner and very handsome. After that and taking our leaves of the officers of the yard, we walked to the waterside and in our way walked into the rope-yard, where I do look into the tar-houses and other places, and took great notice of all the several works belonging to the making of a cable. So after a cup of burnt wine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-880" id="noteref-880" epub:type="noteref">880</a> at the tavern there, we took barge and went to Blackwall and viewed the dock and the new Wet dock, which is newly made there, and a brave new merchantman which is to be launched shortly, and they say to be called the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Royal Oak</i>. Hence we walked to Dick-Shore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-881" id="noteref-881" epub:type="noteref">881</a> and thence to the Towre and so home. Where I found my wife and Pall abroad, so I went to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and there found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry come to see him, and now had an opportunity to thank him, and he did express much kindness to me. I sat a great while with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> after he was gone, and had much talk with him. I perceive none of our officers care much for one another, but I do keep in with them all as much as I can. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn is still very ill as when I went. Home, where my wife not yet come home, so I went up to put my papers in order, and then was much troubled my wife was not come, it being 10 o’clock just now striking as I write this last line. This day I hear the Princess is recovered again. The King hath been this afternoon at Deptford, to see the yacht that Commissioner Pett<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-882" id="noteref-882" epub:type="noteref">882</a> is building, which will be very pretty; as also that that his brother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-883" id="noteref-883" epub:type="noteref">883</a> at Woolwich is in making. By and by comes in my boy and tells me that his mistress do lie this night at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt’s, who is very ill, with which being something satisfied, I went to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-01-26">16th</time>. This morning I went early to the Comptroller’s and so with him by coach to Whitehall, to wait upon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry to give him an account of what we have done, which having done, I went away to wait upon my Lady; but coming to her lodgings I find that she is gone this morning to Chatham by coach, thinking to meet me there, which did trouble me exceedingly, and I did not know what to do, being loth to follow her, and yet could not imagine what she would do when she found me not there. In this trouble, I went to take a walk in Westminster Hall and by chance met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Child, who went forth with my Lady today, but his horse being bad, he come back again, which then did trouble me more, so that I did resolve to go to her; and so by boat home and put on my boots, and so over to Southwarke to the posthouse, and there took horse and guide to Dartford and thence to Rochester (I having good horses and good way, come thither about half-an-hour after daylight, which was before 6 o’clock and I set forth after two), where I found my Lady and her daughter Jem., and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Browne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-884" id="noteref-884" epub:type="noteref">884</a> and five servants, all at a great loss, not finding me here, but at my coming she was overjoyed. The sport was how she had intended to have kept herself unknown, and how the Captain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-885" id="noteref-885" epub:type="noteref">885</a> (whom she had sent for) of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i> had forsoothed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-886" id="noteref-886" epub:type="noteref">886</a> her, though he knew her well and she him. In fine we supped merry and so to bed, there coming several of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i>’s men to see me before, I got to bed. The page lay with me.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-01-27">17th</time>. Up, and breakfast with my Lady. Then come Captains Cuttance and Blake to carry her in the barge on board; and so we went through Ham Creeke to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Soverayne</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-887" id="noteref-887" epub:type="noteref">887</a> (a goodly sight all the way to see the brave ships that lie here) first, which is a most noble ship. I never saw her before. My Lady Sandwich, my Lady Jemimah, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Browne, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Grace, and Mary and the page, my lady’s servants and myself, all went into the lantern together. From thence to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i>, where my lady took great pleasure to see all the rooms, and to hear me tell her how things are when my Lord is there. After we had seen all, then the officers of the ship had prepared a handsome breakfast for her, and while she was pledging my Lord’s health they give her five guns. That done, we went off, and then they give us thirteen guns more. I confess it was a great pleasure to myself to see the ship that I begun my good fortune in. From thence on board the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Newcastle</i>, to show my Lady the difference between a great and a small ship. Among these ships I did give away £7. So back again and went on shore at Chatham, where I had ordered the coach to wait for us. Here I heard that Sir William Batten and his lady (who I knew were here, and did endeavour to avoyd) were now gone this morning to London. So we took coach, and I went into the coach, and went through the town, without making stop at our inn, but left <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Goods to pay the reckoning. So I rode with my lady in the coach, and the page on the horse that I should have rid on⁠—he desiring it. It begun to be dark before we could come to Dartford, and to rain hard, and the horses to fayle, which was our great care to prevent, for fear of my Lord’s displeasure, so here we sat up for tonight, as also Captains Cuttance and Blake, who came along with us. We sat and talked till supper, and at supper my Lady and I entered into a great dispute concerning what were best for a man to do with his estate⁠—whether to make his elder son heir, which my Lady is for, and I against, but rather to make all equall. This discourse took us much time, till it was time to go to bed; but we being merry, we bade my Lady goodnight, and intended to have gone to the Post-house to drink, and hear a pretty girl play of the cittern (and indeed we should have lain there, but by a mistake we did not), but it was late, and we could not hear her, and the guard came to examine what we were; so we returned to our Inn and to bed, the page and I in one bed, and the two captains in another, all in one chamber, where we had very good mirth with our most abominable lodging.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-01-28">18th</time>. The Captains went with me to the post-house about 9 o’clock, and after a morning draft I took horse and guide for London; and through some rain, and a great wind in my face, I got to London at eleven o’clock. At home found all well, but the monkey loose, which did anger me, and so I did strike her till she was almost dead, that they might make her fast again, which did still trouble me more. In the afternoon we met at the office and sat till night, and then I to see my father who I found well, and took him to Standing’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-888" id="noteref-888" epub:type="noteref">888</a> to drink a cup of ale. He told me my aunt at Brampton is yet alive and my mother well there. In comes Will Joyce to us drunk, and in a talking vapouring humour of his state, and I know not what, which did vex me cruelly. After him <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollier had learned at my father’s that I was here (where I had appointed to meet him) and so he did give me some things to take for prevention. Will Joyce not letting us talk as I would I left my father and him and took <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollier to the Greyhound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-889" id="noteref-889" epub:type="noteref">889</a> where he did advise me above all things, both as to the stone and the decay of my memory (of which I now complain to him), to avoid drinking often, which I am resolved, if I can, to leave off. Hence home, and took home with me from the bookseller’s Ogilby’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Aesop</i>, which he had bound for me, and indeed I am very much pleased with the book. Home and to bed.</p>

Where we walked up and down, and at last found Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, whom I had not seen a great while, and did discourse with him about our assisting the Commissioners in paying off the Fleet, which we think to decline.

Hence to my Lady, who told me how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hetley is dead of the smallpox going to Portsmouth with my Lord. My Lady went forth to dinner to her father’s, and so I went to the Leg in King Street and had a rabbit for myself and my Will, and after dinner I sent him home and myself went to the Theatre, where I saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Lost Lady</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-891" id="noteref-891" epub:type="noteref">891</a> which do not please me much.

It is strange what weather we have had all this winter; no cold at all; but the ways are dusty, and the flies fly up and down, and the rosebushes are full of leaves, such a time of the year as was never known in this world before here. This day many more of the Fifth Monarchy men were hanged.</p>

And also to what perfection he hath now brought the art of memory; that he did lately to four eminently great scholars dictate together in Latin, upon different subjects of their proposing, faster than they were able to write, till they were tired; and by the way in discourse tells me that the best way of beginning a sentence, if a man should be out and forget his last sentence (which he never was), that then his last refuge is to begin with an Utcunque.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-896" id="noteref-896" epub:type="noteref">896</a> From thence I to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bowyer’s, and there sat a while, and so to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fox’s, and sat with them a very little while, and then by coach home, and so to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Penn, where we found <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martha Batten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-897" id="noteref-897" epub:type="noteref">897</a> and two handsome ladies more, and so we stayed supper and were very merry, and so home to bed.</p>

Thence at noon to my Lord’s, where my Lady not well, so I eat a mouthfull of dinner there, and thence to the Theatre, and there sat in the pit among the company of fine ladies, <abbr>etc.</abbr>; and the house was exceeding full, to see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Argalus and Parthenia</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-914" id="noteref-914" epub:type="noteref">914</a> the first time that it hath been acted: and indeed it is good, though wronged by my over great expectations, as all things else are. Thence to my father’s to see my mother, who is pretty well after her journey from Brampton. She tells me my aunt is pretty well, yet cannot live long. My uncle pretty well too, and she believes would marry again were my aunt dead, which God forbid. So home.</p>
