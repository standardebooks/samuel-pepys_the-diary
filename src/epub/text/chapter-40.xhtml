			<article id="entry-1663-4-11" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-11">April 1st</time>. Up betimes and abroad to my brother’s, but he being gone out I went to the Temple to my Cousin Roger Pepys, to see and talk with him a little; who tells me that, with much ado, the Parliament do agree to throw down Popery; but he says it is with so much spite and passion, and an endeavour of bringing all Nonconformists into the same condition, that he is afeard matters will not yet go so well as he could wish. Thence back to my brother’s, in my way meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore and talking with him about getting me some money, and calling at my brother’s they tell me that my brother is still abroad, and that my father is not yet up. At which I wondered, not thinking that he was come, though I expected him, because I looked for him at my house. So I up to his bedside and stayed an hour or two talking with him. Among other things he tells me how unquiet my mother is grown, that he is not able to live almost with her, if it were not for Pall. All other matters are as well as upon so hard conditions with my uncle Thomas we can expect them. I left him in bed, being very weary, to come to my house tonight or tomorrow, when he pleases, and so I home, calling on the virginall maker, buying a rest for myself to tune my triangle, and taking one of his people along with me to put it in tune once more, by which I learned how to go about it myself for the time to come. So to dinner, my wife being lazily in bed all this morning. Ashwell and I dined below together, and a pretty girl she is, and I hope will give my wife and myself good content, being very humble and active, my cook-maid do also dress my meat very well and neatly. So to my office all the afternoon till night, and then home, calling at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, where was Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, I telling them how by my letter this day from Commissioner Pett I hear that his Stempeese<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1741" id="noteref-1741" epub:type="noteref">1741</a> he undertook for the new ship at Woolwich, which we have been so long, to our shame, in looking for, do prove knotty and not fit for service. Lord! how Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, like a mad coxcomb, did swear and stamp, swearing that Commissioner Pett hath still the old heart against the King that ever he had, and that this was his envy against his brother that was to build the ship, and all the damnable reproaches in the world, at which I was ashamed, but said little; but, upon the whole, I find him still a fool, led by the nose with stories told by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, whether with or without reason. So, vexed in my mind to see things ordered so unlike gentlemen, or men of reason, I went home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-04-12">2nd</time>. Up by very betimes and to my office, where all the morning till towards noon, and then by coach to Westminster Hall with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and while he went up to the House I walked in the Hall with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, the surgeon, that I met there, talking about my business the other day with Holmes, whom I told my mind, and did freely tell how I do depend upon my care and diligence in my employment to bear me out against the pride of Holmes or any man else in things that are honest, and much to that purpose which I know he will make good use of. But he did advise me to take as few occasions as I can of disobliging Commanders, though this is one that everybody is glad to hear that he do receive a check. By and by the House rises and I home again with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and all the way talking of the same business, to whom I did on purpose tell him my mind freely, and let him see that it must be a wiser man than Holmes (in these very words) that shall do me any hurt while I do my duty. I to remember him of Holmes’s words against Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, that he was a knave, rogue, coward, and that he will kick him and pull him by the ears, which he remembered all of them and may have occasion to do it hereafter to his own shame to suffer them to be spoke in his presence without any reply but what I did give him, which, has caused all this feud. But I am glad of it, for I would now and then take occasion to let the world know that I will not be made a novice. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn took occasion to speak about my wife’s strangeness to him and his daughter, and that believing at last that it was from his taking of Sarah to be his maid, he hath now put her away, at which I am glad. He told me, that this day the King hath sent to the House his concurrence wholly with them against the Popish priests, Jesuits, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, which gives great content, and I am glad of it. So home, whither my father comes and dines with us, and being willing to be merry with him I made myself so as much as I could, and so to the office, where we sat all the afternoon, and at night having done all my business I went home to my wife and father, and supped, and so to bed, my father lying with me in Ashwell’s bed in the red chamber.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-13">3rd</time>. Waked betimes and talked half an hour with my father, and so I rose and to my office, and about 9 o’clock by water from the Old Swan to Whitehall and to chapel, which being most monstrous full, I could not go into my pew, but sat among the quire. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Creeton, the Scotchman, preached a most admirable, good, learned, honest and most severe sermon, yet comicall, upon the words of the woman concerning the Virgin, “Blessed is the womb that bare thee (meaning Christ) and the paps that gave thee suck; and he answered, Nay; rather is he blessed that heareth the word of God, and keepeth it.” He railed bitterly ever and anon against John Calvin, and his brood, the Presbyterians, and against the present term, now in use, of “tender consciences.” He ripped up Hugh Peters<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1742" id="noteref-1742" epub:type="noteref">1742</a> (calling him the execrable skellum),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1743" id="noteref-1743" epub:type="noteref">1743</a> his preaching and stirring up the maids of the city to bring in their bodkins and thimbles. Thence going out of Whitehall, I met Captain Grove, who did give me a letter directed to myself from himself. I discerned money to be in it, and took it, knowing, as I found it to be, the proceed of the place I have got him to be, the taking up of vessels for Tangier. But I did not open it till I came home to my office, and there I broke it open, not looking into it till all the money was out, that I might say I saw no money in the paper, if ever I should be questioned about it. There was a piece in gold and £4 in silver. So home to dinner with my father and wife, and after dinner up to my triangle, where I found that above my expectation Ashwell has very good principles of music and can take out a lesson herself with very little pains, at which I am very glad. Thence away back again by water to Whitehall, and there to the Tangier Committee, where we find ourselves at a great stand; the establishment being but £70,000 per annum, and the forces to be kept in the town at the least estimate that my Lord Rutherford can be got to bring it is £53,000. The charge of this year’s work of the Mole will be £13,000; besides £1,000 a-year to my Lord Peterborough as a pension, and the fortifications and contingencies, which puts us to a great stand, and so unsettled what to do therein we rose, and I to see my Lord Sandwich, whom I found merry at cards, and so by coach home, and after supper a little to my office and so home and to bed. I find at Court that there is some bad news from Ireland of an insurrection of the Catholics there, which puts them into an alarm. I hear also in the City that for certain there is an embargo upon all our ships in Spain, upon this action of my Lord Windsor’s at Cuba, which signifies little or nothing, but only he hath a mind to say that he hath done something before he comes back again. Late tonight I sent to invite my uncle Wight and aunt with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner tomorrow.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-14">4th</time>. Up betimes and to my office. By and by to Lombard street by appointment to meet <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, but the business not being ready I returned to the office, where we sat a while, and, being sent for, I returned to him and there signed to some papers in the conveying of some lands mortgaged by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Rob.</abbr> Parkhurst in my name to my Lord Sandwich, which I having done I returned home to dinner, whither by and by comes Roger Pepys, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner her daughter, Joyce Norton,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1744" id="noteref-1744" epub:type="noteref">1744</a> and a young lady, a daughter of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Coll.</abbr> Cockes, my uncle Wight, his wife and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Anne Wight. This being my feast, in lieu of what I should have had a few days ago for my cutting of the stone, for which the Lord make me truly thankful. Very merry at, before, and after dinner, and the more for that my dinner was great, and most neatly dressed by our own only maid. We had a fricasee of rabbits and chickens, a leg of mutton boiled, three carps in a dish, a great dish of a side of lamb, a dish of roasted pigeons, a dish of four lobsters, three tarts, a lamprey pie (a most rare pie), a dish of anchovies, good wine of several sorts, and all things mighty noble and to my great content. After dinner to Hide Park; my aunt, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wight and I in one coach, and all the rest of the women in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s; Roger being gone in haste to the Parliament about the carrying this business of the Papists, in which it seems there is great contest on both sides, and my uncle and father staying together behind. At the Park was the King, and in another coach my Lady Castlemaine, they greeting one another at every tour.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1745" id="noteref-1745" epub:type="noteref">1745</a> Here about an hour, and so leaving all by the way we home and found the house as clean as if nothing had been done there today from top to bottom, which made us give the cook 12<abbr>d.</abbr> a piece, each of us. So to my office about writing letters by the post, one to my brother John at Brampton telling him (hoping to work a good effect by it upon my mother) how melancholy my father is, and bidding him use all means to get my mother to live peaceably and quietly, which I am sure she neither do nor I fear can ever do, but frightening her with his coming down no more, and the danger of her condition if he should die I trust may do good. So home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-04-15">5th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up and spent the morning, till the Barber came, in reading in my chamber part of Osborne’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Advice to His Son</i> (which I shall not never enough admire for sense and language), and being by and by trimmed, to Church, myself, wife, Ashwell, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Home to dinner, it raining, while that was prepared to my office to read over my vows with great affection and to very good purpose. So to dinner, and very well pleased with it. Then to church again, where a simple bawling young Scot preached. So home to my office alone till dark, reading some papers of my old navy precedents, and so home to supper, and, after some pleasant talk, my wife, Ashwell, and I to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-16">6th</time>. Up very betimes and to my office, and there made an end of reading my book that I have of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlow’s of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journal of the Commissioners of the Navy</i>, who begun to act in the year 1628 and continued six years, wherein is fine observations and precedents out of which I do purpose to make a good collection. By and by, much against my will, being twice sent for, to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s to pass his accounts there, upon which Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and myself all the morning, and again after dinner to it, being vexed at my heart to see a thing of that importance done so slightly and with that neglect for which God pardon us, and I would I could mend it. Thence leaving them I made an excuse and away home, and took my wife by coach and left her at Madam Clerk’s, to make a visit there, and I to the Committee of Tangier, where I found, to my great joy, my Lord Sandwich, the first time I have seen him abroad these some months, and by and by he rose and took leave, being, it seems, this night to go to Kensington or Chelsey, where he hath taken a lodging for a while to take the air. We stayed, and after business done I got <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry into the Matted Gallery and told him my whole mind concerning matters of our office, all my discontent to see things of so great trust carried so neglectfully, and what pitiful service the Controller and Surveyor make of their duties, and I disburdened my mind wholly to him and he to me his own, many things, telling me that he is much discouraged by seeing things not to grow better and better as he did well hope they would have done. Upon the whole, after a full hour’s private discourse, telling one another our minds, we with great content parted, and with very great satisfaction for my [having] thus cleared my conscience, went to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Clerk’s and thence fetched my wife, and by coach home. To my office a little to set things in order, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-17">7th</time>. Up very betimes, and angry with Will that he made no more haste to rise after I called him. So to my office, and all the morning there. At noon to the Exchange, and so home to dinner, where I found my wife had been with Ashwell to La Roche’s to have her tooth drawn, which it seems aches much, but my wife could not get her to be contented to have it drawn after the first twich, but would let it alone, and so they came home with it undone, which made my wife and me good sport. After dinner to the office, where Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes did make a great complaint to me alone, how my clerk <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater had entered in one of the Sea books a ticket to have been signed by him before it had been examined, which makes the old fool mad almost, though there was upon enquiry the greatest reason in the world for it. Which though it vexes me, yet it is most to see from day to day what a coxcomb he is, and that so great a trust should lie in the hands of such a fool. We sat all the afternoon, and I late at my office, it being post night, and so home to supper, my father being come again to my house, and after supper to bed, and after some talk to sleep.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-18">8th</time>. Up betimes and to my office, and by and by, about 8 o’clock, to the Temple to Commissioner Pett lately come to town and discoursed about the affairs of our office, how ill they go through the corruption and folly of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes. Thence by water to Whitehall, to chapel; where preached <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pierce, the famous man that preached the sermon so much cried up, before the King against the Papists. His matter was the Devil tempting our Saviour, being carried into the Wilderness by the spirit. And he hath as much of natural eloquence as most men that ever I heard in my life, mixed with so much learning. After sermon I went up and saw the ceremony of the Bishop of Peterborough’s paying homage upon the knee to the King, while Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Bennet, Secretary, read the King’s grant of the Bishopric of Lincoln, to which he is translated. His name is <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Lany.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1746" id="noteref-1746" epub:type="noteref">1746</a> Here I also saw the Duke of Monmouth, with his Order of the Garter, the first time I ever saw it. I am told that the University of Cambridge did treat him a little while since with all the honour possible, with a comedy at Trinity College, and banquet; and made him Master of Arts there. All which, they say, the King took very well. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Raynbow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1747" id="noteref-1747" epub:type="noteref">1747</a> Master of Magdalen, being now Vice-Chancellor. Home by water to dinner, and with my father, wife, and Ashwell, after dinner, by water towards Woolwich, and in our way I bethought myself that we had left our poor little dog that followed us out of doors at the waterside, and God knows whether he be not lost, which did not only strike my wife into a great passion but I must confess myself also; more than was becoming me. We immediately returned, I taking another boat and with my father went to Woolwich, while they went back to find the dog. I took my father on board the King’s pleasure boat and down to Woolwich, and walked to Greenwich thence and turning into the park to show my father the steps up the hill, we found my wife, her woman, and dog attending us, which made us all merry again, and so took boats, they to Deptford and so by land to Halfway house, I into the King’s yard and overlook them there, and eat and drank with them, and saw a company of seamen play drolly at our pence, and so home by water. I a little at the office, and so home to supper and to bed, after having Ashwell play my father and me a lesson upon her Triangle.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-19">9th</time>. Up betimes and to my office, and anon we met upon finishing the Treasurer’s accounts. At noon dined at home and am vexed to hear my wife tell me how our maid Mary do endeavour to corrupt our cook-maid, which did please me very well, but I am resolved to rid the house of her as soon as I can. To the office and sat all the afternoon till 9 at night, and an hour after home to supper and bed. My father lying at Tom’s tonight, he dining with my uncle Fenner and his sons and a great many more of the gang at his own cost today. To bed vexed also to think of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes finding fault with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater for what he had done the other day, though there be no hurt in the thing at all but only the old fool’s jealousy, made worse by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1663-4-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-20">10th</time>. Up very betimes and to my office, where most hard at business alone all the morning. At noon to the Exchange, where I hear that after great expectation from Ireland, and long stop of letters, there is good news come, that all is quiet after our great noise of troubles there, though some stir hath been as was reported. Off the Exchange with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Cutler and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grant to the Royal Oak Tavern, in Lombard Street,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1748" id="noteref-1748" epub:type="noteref">1748</a> where Alexander Broome<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1749" id="noteref-1749" epub:type="noteref">1749</a> the poet was, a merry and witty man, I believe, if he be not a little conceited, and here drank a sort of French wine, called Ho Bryan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1750" id="noteref-1750" epub:type="noteref">1750</a> that hath a good and most particular taste that I never met with. Home to dinner, and then by water abroad to Whitehall, my wife to see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ferrers, I to Whitehall and the Park, doing no business. Then to my Lord’s lodgings, met my wife, and walked to the New Exchange. There laid out 10<abbr>s.</abbr> upon pendents and painted leather gloves, very pretty and all the mode. So by coach home and to my office till late, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-04-21">11th</time>. Up betimes and to my office, where we sat also all the morning till noon, and then home to dinner, my father being there but not very well. After dinner in comes Captain Lambert of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Norwich</i>, this day come from Tangier, whom I am glad to see. There came also with him Captain Wager, and afterwards in came Captain Allen to see me, of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Resolution</i>. All stayed a pretty while, and so away, and I a while to my office, then abroad into the street with my father, and left him to go to see my aunt Wight and uncle, intending to lie at Tom’s tonight, or my cousin Scott’s, where it seems he has hitherto lain and is most kindly used there. So I home and to my office very late making up my Lord’s navy accounts, wherein I find him to stand debtor £1,200. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-22">12th (Lord’s day)</time>. Lay till 8 o’clock, which I have not done a great while, then up and to church, where I found our pew altered by taking some of the hind pew to make ours bigger, because of the number of women, more by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes company than we used to have. Home to dinner, and after dinner, intending to go to Chelsey to my Lord Sandwich, my wife would needs go with me, though she walked on foot to Whitehall. Which she did and stayed at my Lord’s lodgings while Creed and I took a turn at Whitehall, but no coach to be had, and so I returned to them and sat talking till evening, and then got a coach and to Gray’s Inn walks, where some handsome faces, and so home and there to supper, and a little after 8 o’clock to bed, a thing I have not done God knows when. Coming home tonight, a drunken boy was carrying by our constable to our new pair of stocks to handsel them, being a new pair and very handsome.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-04-23">13th</time>. Up by five o’clock and to my office, where hard at work till towards noon, and home and eat a bit, and so going out met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mount my old acquaintance, and took him in and drank a glass or two of wine to him and so parted, having not time to talk together, and I with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten to the Stillyard, and there eat a lobster together, and Wyse the King’s fishmonger coming in we were very merry half an hour, and so by water to Whitehall, and by and by being all met we went in to the Duke and there did our business and so away, and anon to the Tangier Committee, where we had very fine discourse from <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Walker and Wiseman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1751" id="noteref-1751" epub:type="noteref">1751</a> civilians, against our erecting a court-merchant at Tangier, and well answered in many things by my Lord Sandwich (whose speaking I never till now observed so much to be very good) and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford. By and by the discourse being ended, we fell to my Lord Rutherford’s dispatch, which do not please him, he being a Scott, and one resolved to scrape every penny that he can get by any way, which the Committee will not agree to. He took offence at something and rose away, without taking leave of the board, which all took ill, though nothing said but only by the Duke of Albemarle, who said that we ought to settle things as they ought to be, and if he will not go upon these terms another man will, no doubt. Here late, quite finishing things against his going, and so rose, and I walked home, being accompanied by Creed to Temple Bar, talking of this afternoon’s passage, and so I called at the Wardrobe in my way home, and there spoke at the Horn tavern with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore a word or two, but my business was with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend, who is gone this day to his country house, about sparing Charles Pepys some money of his bills due to him when he can, but missing him lost my labour. So walked home, finding my wife abroad, at my aunt, Wight’s, who coming home by and by, I home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-4-24" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-04-24">14th</time>. Up betimes to my office, where busy till 8 o’clock that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and I down by barge to Woolwich, to see <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">The Royal James</i> launched, where she has been under repair a great while. We stayed in the yard till almost noon, and then to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer’s to a dinner of fish of our own sending, and when it was just ready to come upon the table, word is brought that the King and Duke are come, so they all went away to show themselves, while I stayed and had a little dish or two by myself, resolving to go home, and by the time I had dined they came again, having gone to little purpose, the King, I believe, taking little notice of them. So they to dinner, and I stayed a little with them, and so goodbye. I walked to Greenwich, studying the slide rule for measuring of timber, which is very fine. Thence to Deptford by water, and walked through the yard, and so walked to Redriffe, and so home pretty weary, to my office, where anon they all came home, the ship well launched, and so sat at the office till 9 at night, and I longer doing business at my office, and so home to supper, my father being come, and to bed. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret tells me tonight that he perceives the Parliament is likely to make a great bustle before they will give the King any money; will call all things into question; and, above all, the expenses of the Navy; and do enquire into the King’s expenses everywhere, and into the truth of the report of people being forced to sell their bills at 15 percent loss in the Navy; and, lastly, that they are in a very angry pettish mood at present, and not likely to be better.</p>

Up betimes, and after talking with my father awhile, I to my office, and there hard at it till almost noon, and then went down the river with Maynes, the purveyor, to show a ship’s lading of Norway goods, and called at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Warren’s yard, and so home to dinner. After dinner up with my wife and Ashwell a little to the Triangle, and so I down to Deptford by land about looking out a couple of catches fitted to be speedily set forth in answer to a letter of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry’s to me. Which done, I walked back again, all the way reading of my book of Timber measure, comparing it with my new Sliding Rule brought home this morning with great pleasure. Taking boat again I went to Shishe’s yard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1752" id="noteref-1752" epub:type="noteref">1752</a> but he being newly gone out towards Deptford I followed him thither again, and there seeing him I went with him and pitched upon a couple, and so by water home, it being late, past 8 at night, the wind cold, and I a little weary. So home to my office, then to supper and bed.</p>

Up betimes and to my office, met to pass <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pitt’s (anon Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Lawson’s Secretary and Deputy Treasurer) accounts for the voyage last to the Streights, wherein the demands are strangely irregular, and I dare not oppose it alone for making an enemy and do no good, but only bring a review upon my Lord Sandwich, but God knows it troubles my heart to see it, and to see the Comptroller, whose duty it is, to make no more matter of it. At noon home for an hour to dinner, and so to the office public and private till late at night, so home to supper and bed with my father.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-04-27">17th</time>. Up by five o’clock as I have long done and to my office all the morning, at noon home to dinner with my father with us. Our dinner, it being Good Friday, was only sugarsopps and fish; the only time that we have had a Lenten dinner all this Lent. This morning <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hunt, the instrument maker, brought me home a Bass Viol to see whether I like it, which I do not very well, besides I am under a doubt whether I had best buy one yet or no, because of spoiling my present mind and love to business. After dinner my father and I walked into the city a little, and parted and to Paul’s Church Yard, to cause the title of my English <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Mare Clausum</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1753" id="noteref-1753" epub:type="noteref">1753</a> to be changed, and the new title, dedicated to the King, to be put to it, because I am ashamed to have the other seen dedicated to the Commonwealth. So home and to my office till night, and so home to talk with my father, and supper and to bed, I have not had yet one quarter of an hour’s leisure to sit down and talk with him since he came to town, nor do I know till the holidays when I shall.</p>

With us <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, who has been deeply engaged at the office this day about the ending of his accounts, wherein he is most unhappy to have to do with a company of fools who after they have signed his accounts and made bills upon them yet dare not boldly assert to the Treasurer that they are satisfied with his accounts. Hereupon all dinner, and walking in the garden the afternoon, he and I talking of the ill management of our office, which God knows is very ill for the King’s advantage. I would I could make it better. In the evening to my office, and at night home to supper and bed.</p>

Up and this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome. To church alone, and so to dinner, where my father and brother Tom dined with us, and after dinner to church again, my father sitting below in the chancel. After church done, where the young Scotchman preaching I slept all the while, my father and I to see my uncle and aunt Wight, and after a stay of an hour there my father to my brother’s and I home to supper, and after supper fell in discourse of dancing, and I find that Ashwell hath a very fine carriage, which makes my wife almost ashamed of herself to see herself so outdone, but tomorrow she begins to learn to dance for a month or two. So to prayers and to bed. Will being gone, with my leave, to his father’s this day for a day or two, to take physic these holydays.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-04-30">20th</time>. Up betimes as I use to do, and in my chamber begun to look over my father’s accounts, which he brought out of the country with him by my desire, whereby I may see what he has received and spent, and I find that he is not anything extravagant, and yet it do so far outdo his estate that he must either think of lessening his charge, or I must be forced to spare money out of my purse to help him through, which I would willing do as far as £20 goes. So to my office the remaining part of the morning till towards noon, and then to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Grant’s. There saw his prints, which he showed me, and indeed are the best collection of any things almost that ever I saw, there being the prints of most of the greatest houses, churches, and antiquities in Italy and France and brave cutts. I had not time to look them over as I ought, and which I will take time hereafter to do, and therefore left them and home to dinner. After dinner, it raining very hard, by coach to Whitehall, where, after Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and I had been with the Duke, we to the Committee of Tangier and did matters there dispatching wholly my Lord Teviott, and so broke up. With Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret and Sir John Minnes by coach to my Lord Treasurer’s, thinking to have spoken about getting money for paying the Yards; but we found him with some ladies at cards: and so, it being a bad time to speak, we parted, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes and I home, and after walking with my wife in the garden late, to supper and to bed, being somewhat troubled at Ashwell’s desiring and insisting over eagerly upon her going to a ball to meet some of her old companions at a dancing school here in town next Friday, but I am resolved she shall not go. So to bed. This day the little Duke of Monmouth was married at Whitehall, in the King’s chamber; and tonight is a great supper and dancing at his lodgings, near Charing-Cross.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1754" id="noteref-1754" epub:type="noteref">1754</a> I observed his coat at the tail of his coach he gives the arms of England, Scotland, and France, quartered upon some other fields, but what it is that speaks his being a bastard I know not.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1755" id="noteref-1755" epub:type="noteref">1755</a></p>

So to business, and then home to dinner, and after dinner to sit at the office in the afternoon, and thence to my study late, and so home to supper to play a game at cards with my wife, and so to bed.

So to the ’Change, and so to my uncle Wight’s, by invitation, whither my father, wife, and Ashwell came, where we had but a poor dinner, and not well dressed; besides, the very sight of my aunt’s hands and greasy manner of carving, did almost turn my stomach. After dinner by coach to the King’s Playhouse, where we saw but part of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Witt Without Mony</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1756" id="noteref-1756" epub:type="noteref">1756</a> which I do not like much, but coming late put me out of tune, and it costing me four half-crowns for myself and company. So, the play done, home, and I to my office a while and so home, where my father (who is so very melancholy) and we played at cards, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-05-03">23rd</time>. <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s day and Coronacion, the King and Court being at Windsor, at the installing of the King of Denmark by proxy and the Duke of Monmouth. I up betimes, and with my father, having a fire made in my wife’s new closet above, it being a wet and cold day, we sat there all the morning looking over his country accounts ever since his going into the country. I find his spending hitherto has been (without extraordinary charges) at full £100 per annum, which troubles me, and I did let him apprehend it, so as that the poor man wept, though he did make it well appear to me that he could not have saved a farthing of it. I did tell him how things stand with us, and did show my distrust of Pall, both for her good nature and housewifery, which he was sorry for, telling me that indeed she carries herself very well and carefully, which I am glad to hear, though I doubt it was but his doting and not being able to find her miscarriages so well nowadays as he could heretofore have done. We resolve upon sending for Will Stankes up to town to give us a right understanding in all that we have in Brampton, and before my father goes to settle everything so as to resolve how to find a living for my father and to pay debts and legacies, and also to understand truly how Tom’s condition is in the world, that we may know what we are like to expect of his doing ill or well. So to dinner, and after dinner to the office, where some of us met and did a little business, and so to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s to see a little picture drawing of his by a Dutchman which is very well done. So to my office and put a few things in order, and so home to spend the evening with my father. At cards till late, and being at supper, my boy being sent for some mustard to a neat’s tongue, the rogue stayed half an hour in the streets, it seems at a bonfire, at which I was very angry, and resolve to beat him tomorrow.</p>

Up betimes, and with my salt eel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1757" id="noteref-1757" epub:type="noteref">1757</a> went down in the parlor and there got my boy and did beat him till I was fain to take breath two or three times, yet for all I am afeard it will make the boy never the better, he is grown so hardened in his tricks, which I am sorry for, he being capable of making a brave man, and is a boy that I and my wife love very well. So made me ready, and to my office, where all the morning, and at noon home, whither came Captain Holland, who is lately come home from sea, and has been much harassed in law about the ship which he has bought, so that it seems in a despair he endeavoured to cut his own throat, but is recovered it; and it seems whether by that or any other persuasion (his wife’s mother being a great zealot) he is turned almost a Quaker, his discourse being nothing but holy, and that impertinent, that I was weary of him. At last pretending to go to the ’Change we walked thither together, and there I left him and home to dinner, sending my boy by the way to enquire after two dancing masters at our end of the town for my wife to learn, of whose names the boy brought word. After dinner all the afternoon fiddling upon my violin (which I have not done many a day) while Ashwell danced above in my upper best chamber, which is a rare room for music, expecting this afternoon my wife to bring my cousin Scott and Stradwick, but they came not, and so in the evening we by ourselves to Halfway house to walk, but did not go in there, but only a walk and so home again and to supper, my father with us, and had a good lobster intended for part of our entertainment to these people today, and so to cards, and then to bed, being the first day that I have spent so much to my pleasure a great while.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-05-05">25th</time>. Up betimes and to my viol and song book a pretty while, and so to my office, and there we sat all the morning. Among other things Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten had a mind to cause Butler (our chief witness in the business of Field, whom we did force back from an employment going to sea to come back to attend our lawsuit) to be borne as a mate on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Rainbow</i> in the Downs in compensation for his loss for our sakes. This he orders an order to be drawn by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Turner for, and after Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn had signed it, it came to me and I was going to put it up into my book, thinking to consider of it and give them my opinion upon it before I parted with it, but Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn told me I must sign it or give it him again, for it should not go without my hand. I told him what I meant to do, whereupon Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten was very angry, and in a great heat (which will bring out anything which he has in his mind, and I am glad of it, though it is base in him to have a thing so long in his mind without speaking of it, though I am glad this is the worst, for if he had worse it would out as well as this some time or other) told me that I should not think as I have heretofore done, make them sign orders and not sign them myself. Which what ignorance or worse it implies is easy to judge, when he shall sign to things (and the rest of the board too as appears in this business) for company and not out of their judgment for. After some discourse I did convince them that it was not fit to have it go, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten first, and then the rest, did willingly cancel all their hands and tear the order, for I told them, Butler being such a rogue as I know him, and we have all signed him to be to the Duke, it will be in his power to publish this to our great reproach, that we should take such a course as this to serve ourselves in wronging the King by putting him into a place he is no wise capable of, and that in an Admiral ship. At noon we rose, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten ashamed and vexed, and so home to dinner, and after dinner walked to the old Exchange and so all along to Westminster Hall, Whitehall, my Lord Sandwich’s lodgings, and going by water back to the Temple did pay my debts in several places in order to my examining my accounts tomorrow to my great content. So in the evening home, and after supper (my father at my brother’s) and merrily practising to dance, which my wife hath begun to learn this day of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pembleton,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1758" id="noteref-1758" epub:type="noteref">1758</a> but I fear will hardly do any great good at it, because she is conceited that she do well already, though I think no such thing. So to bed. At Westminster Hall, this day, I buy a book lately printed and licensed by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stradling,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1759" id="noteref-1759" epub:type="noteref">1759</a> the Bishop of London’s chaplain, being a book discovering the practices and designs of the papists, and the fears of some of our own fathers of the Protestant church heretofore of the return to Popery as it were prefacing it. The book is a very good book; but forasmuch as it touches one of the Queen-mother’s fathers confessors, the Bishop, which troubles many good men and members of Parliament, hath called it in, which I am sorry for. Another book I bought, being a collection of many expressions of the great Presbyterian Preachers upon public occasions, in the late times, against the King and his party, as some of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marshall, Case, Calamy, Baxter, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, which is good reading now, to see what they then did teach, and the people believe, and what they would seem to believe now.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1760" id="noteref-1760" epub:type="noteref">1760</a> Lastly, I did hear that the Queen is much grieved of late at the King’s neglecting her, he having not supped once with her this quarter of a year, and almost every night with my Lady Castlemaine; who hath been with him this <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s feast at Windsor, and came home with him last night; and, which is more, they say is removed as to her bed from her own home to a chamber in Whitehall, next to the King’s own; which I am sorry to hear, though I love her much.</p>

In the evening (my father being gone to my brother’s to lie tonight) my wife, Ashwell, and the boy and I, and the dog, over the water and walked to Halfway house, and beyond into the fields, gathering of cowslipps, and so to Halfway house, with some cold lamb we carried with us, and there supped, and had a most pleasant walk back again, Ashwell all along telling us some parts of their mask at Chelsey School, which was very pretty, and I find she hath a most prodigious memory, remembering so much of things acted six or seven years ago. So home, and after reading my vows, being sleepy, without prayers to bed, for which God forgive me!</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-05-07">27th</time>. Up betimes and to my office, where doing business alone a good while till people came about business to me. Will Griffin tells me this morning that Captain Browne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1761" id="noteref-1761" epub:type="noteref">1761</a> Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s brother-in-law, is dead of a blow given him two days ago by a seaman, a servant of his, being drunk, with a stone striking him on the forehead, for which I am sorry, he having a good woman and several small children. At the office all the morning, at noon dined at home with my wife, merry, and after dinner by water to Whitehall; but found the Duke of York gone to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s for this summer; and thence with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, to whose chamber I went, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn up to the Duke’s closet. And a good while with him about our Navy business; and so I to Whitehall, and there alone a while with my Lord Sandwich discoursing about his debt to the Navy, wherein he hath given me some things to resolve him in. Thence to my Lord’s lodging, and thither came Creed to me, and he and I walked a great while in the garden, and thence to an alehouse in the market place to drink fine Lambeth ale, and so to Westminster Hall, and after walking there a great while, home by coach, where I found Mary gone from my wife, she being too high for her, though a very good servant, and my boy too will be going in a few days, for he is not for my family, he is grown so out of order and not to be ruled, and do himself, against his brother’s counsel, desire to be gone, which I am sorry for, because I love the boy and would be glad to bring him to good. At home with my wife and Ashwell talking of her going into the country this year, wherein we had like to have fallen out, she thinking that I have a design to have her go, which I have not, and to let her stay here I perceive will not be convenient, for she expects more pleasure than I can give her here, and I fear I have done very ill in letting her begin to learn to dance. The Queen (which I did not know) it seems was at Windsor, at the late <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s feast there; and the Duke of Monmouth dancing with her with his hat in his hand, the King came in and kissed him, and made him put on his hat, which everybody took notice of. After being a while at my office home to supper and to bed, my Will being come home again after being at his father’s all the last week taking physic.</p>

			<article id="entry-1663-5-9" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1663-05-09">29th</time>. Up betimes, and after having at my office settled some accounts for my Lord Sandwich, I went forth, and taking up my father at my brother’s, took coach and towards Chelsey, ’lighting at an alehouse near the Gatehouse at Westminster to drink our morning draught, and so up again and to Chelsey, where we found my Lord all alone at a little table with one joint of meat at dinner; we sat down and very merry talking, and mightily extolling the manner of his retirement, and the goodness of his diet, which indeed is so finely dressed: the mistress of the house, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Becke, having been a woman of good condition heretofore, a merchant’s wife, and hath all things most excellently dressed; among others, her cakes admirable, and so good that my Lord’s words were, they were fit to present to my Lady Castlemaine. From ordinary discourse my Lord fell to talk of other matters to me, of which chiefly the second part of the fray, which he told me a little while since of, between <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Montagu and himself, which is that after that he had since been with him three times and no notice taken at all of any difference between them, and yet since that he hath forborn coming to him almost two months, and do speak not only slightly of my Lord everywhere, but hath complained to my Lord Chancellor of him, and arrogated all that ever my Lord hath done to be only by his direction and persuasion. Whether he hath done the like to the King or no, my Lord knows not; but my Lord hath been with the King since, and finds all things fair; and my Lord Chancellor hath told him of it, but with so much contempt of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu, as my Lord knows himself very secure against anything the fool can do; and notwithstanding all this, so noble is his nature, that he professes himself ready to show kindness and pity to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu on any occasion. My Lord told me of his presenting Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Bennet with a gold cupp of £100, which he refuses, with a compliment; but my Lord would have been glad he had taken it, that he might have had some obligations upon him which he thinks possible the other may refuse to prevent it; not that he hath any reason to doubt his kindness. But I perceive great differences there are at Court; and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Bennet and my Lord Bristol, and their faction, are likely to carry all things before them (which my Lord’s judgment is, will not be for the best), and particularly against the Chancellor, who, he tells me, is irrecoverably lost: but, however, that he will not actually join in anything against the Chancellor, whom he do own to be his most sure friend, and to have been his greatest; and therefore will not openly act in either, but passively carry himself even. The Queen, my Lord tells me, he thinks he hath incurred some displeasure with, for his kindness to his neighbour, my Lady Castlemaine. My Lord tells me he hath no reason to fall for her sake, whose wit, management, nor interest, is not likely to hold up any man, and therefore he thinks it not his obligation to stand for her against his own interest. The Duke and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry my Lord says he is very well with, and fears not but they will show themselves his very good friends, specially at this time, he being able to serve them, and they needing him, which he did not tell me wherein. Talking of the business of Tangier, he tells me that my Lord Tiviott is gone away without the least respect paid to him, nor indeed to any man, but without his commission; and (if it be true what he says) having laid out seven or eight thousand pounds in commodities for the place; and besides having not only disobliged all the Commissioners for Tangier, but also Sir Charles Barkeley the other day, who, speaking in behalf of Colonel Fitz-Gerald, that having been deputy-governor there already, he ought to have expected and had the governorship upon the death or removal of the former governor.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1762" id="noteref-1762" epub:type="noteref">1762</a> And whereas it is said that he and his men are Irish, which is indeed the main thing that hath moved the King and Council to put in Tiviott to prevent the Irish having too great and the whole command there under Fitz-Gerald; he further said that there was never an Englishman fit to command Tangier; my Lord Tiviott answered yes, that there were many more fit than himself or Fitz-Gerald either. So that Fitz-Gerald being so great with the Duke of York, and being already made deputy-governor, independent of my Lord Tiviott, and he being also left here behind him for a while, my Lord Sandwich do think that, putting all these things together, the few friends he hath left, and the ill posture of his affairs, my Lord Tiviott is not a man of the conduct and management that either people take him to be, or is fit for the command of the place. And here, speaking of the Duke of York and Sir Charles Barkeley, my Lord tells me that he do very much admire the good management, and discretion, and nobleness of the Duke, that whatever he may be led by him or <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry singly in private, yet he did not observe that in public matters, but he did give as ready hearing and as good acceptance to any reasons offered by any other man against the opinions of them, as he did to them, and would concur in the prosecution of it. Then we came to discourse upon his own sea accounts, and came to a resolution what and how to proceed in them; wherein he resolved, though I offered him a way of evading the greatest part of his debt honestly, by making himself debtor to the Parliament, before the King’s time, which he might justly do, yet he resolved to go openly and nakedly in it, and put himself to the kindness of the King and Duke, which humour, I must confess, and so did tell him (with which he was not a little pleased) had thriven very well with him, being known to be a man of candid and open dealing, without any private tricks or hidden designs as other men commonly have in what they do. From that we had discourse of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, who he finds kind to him, but it may be a little envious, and most other men are, and of many others; and upon the whole do find that it is a troublesome thing for a man of any condition at Court to carry himself even, and without contracting enemies or envyers; and that much discretion and dissimulation is necessary to do it. My father stayed a good while at the window and then sat down by himself while my Lord and I were thus an hour together or two after dinner discoursing, and by and by he took his leave, and told me he would stay below for me. Anon I took leave, and coming down found my father unexpectedly in great pain and desiring for God’s sake to get him a bed to lie upon, which I did, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe and I stayed by him, in so great pain as I never saw, poor wretch, and with that patience, crying only: Terrible, terrible pain, God help me, God help me, with the mournful voice, that made my heart ache. He desired to rest a little alone to see whether it would abate, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe and I went down and walked in the gardens, which are very fine, and a pretty fountayne, with which I was finely wetted, and up to a banquetting house, with a very fine prospect, and so back to my father, who I found in such pain that I could not bear the sight of it without weeping, never thinking that I should be able to get him from thence, but at last, finding it like to continue, I got him to go to the coach, with great pain, and driving hard, he all the while in a most unsufferable torment (meeting in the way with Captain Ferrers going to my Lord, to tell him that my Lady Jemimah is come to town, and that Will Stankes is come with my father’s horses), not staying the coach to speak with anybody, but once, in <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s Churchyard, we were forced to stay, the jogging and pain making my father vomit, which it never had done before. At last we got home, and all helping him we got him to bed presently, and after half an hour’s lying in his naked bed (it being a rupture [with] which he is troubled, and has been this 20 years, but never in half the pain and with so great swelling as now, and how this came but by drinking of cold small beer and sitting long upon a low stool and then standing long after it he cannot tell).⁠ ⁠… After which he was at good ease, and so continued, and so fell to sleep, and we went down whither <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Stankes was come with his horses. But it is very pleasant to hear how he rails at the rumbling and ado that is in London over it is in the country, that he cannot endure it. He supped with us, and very merry, and then he to his lodgings at the Inne with the horses, and so we to bed, I to my father who is very well again, and both slept very well.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1663-05-10">30th</time>. Up, and after drinking my morning draft with my father and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Stankes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1763" id="noteref-1763" epub:type="noteref">1763</a> I went forth to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, who is going (to no purpose as he uses to do) to Chatham upon a survey. So to my office, where till towards noon, and then to the Exchange, and back home to dinner, where <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt, my father, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Stankes; but, Lord! what a stir Stankes makes with his being crowded in the streets and wearied in walking in London, and would not be wooed by my wife and Ashwell to go to a play, nor to Whitehall, or to see the lions,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1764" id="noteref-1764" epub:type="noteref">1764</a> though he was carried in a coach. I never could have thought there had been upon earth a man so little curious in the world as he is. At the office all the afternoon till 9 at night, so home to cards with my father, wife, and Ashwell, and so to bed.</p>
