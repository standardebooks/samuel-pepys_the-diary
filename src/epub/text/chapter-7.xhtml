				<p><time datetime="1660-07-11">July 1st</time>. This morning came home my fine Camlett cloak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-578" id="noteref-578" epub:type="noteref">578</a> with gold buttons, and a silk suit, which cost me much money, and I pray God to make me able to pay for it. I went to the cook’s and got a good joint of meat, and my wife and I dined at home alone. In the afternoon to the Abbey, where a good sermon by a stranger, but no Common Prayer yet. After sermon called in at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Crisp’s, where I saw Mynheer Roder,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-579" id="noteref-579" epub:type="noteref">579</a> that is to marry Sam Hartlib’s sister,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-580" id="noteref-580" epub:type="noteref">580</a> a great fortune for her to light on, she being worth nothing in the world. Here I also saw <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Greenlife, who is come again to live in Axe Yard with her new husband <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Adams. Then to my Lord’s, where I stayed a while. So to see for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed to speak about getting a copy of Barlow’s patent. To my Lord’s, where late at night comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Morland, whom I left prating with my Lord, and so home.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-12">2nd</time>. Infinite of business that my heart and head and all were full. Met with purser Washington, with whom and a lady, a friend of his, I dined at the Bell Tavern<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-581" id="noteref-581" epub:type="noteref">581</a> in King Street, but the rogue had no more manners than to invite me and to let me pay my club. All the afternoon with my Lord, going up and down the town; at seven at night he went home, and there the principal Officers of the Navy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-582" id="noteref-582" epub:type="noteref">582</a> among the rest myself was reckoned one. We had order to meet tomorrow, to draw up such an order of the Council as would put us into action before our patents were passed. At which my heart was glad. At night supped with my Lord, he and I together, in the great dining-room alone by ourselves, the first time I ever did it in London. Home to bed, my maid pretty well again.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-13">3rd</time>. All the morning the Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, we met at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-583" id="noteref-583" epub:type="noteref">583</a> chamber, and agreed upon orders for the Council to supersede the old ones, and empower us to act. Dined with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Stephens, the Treasurer’s man of the Navy, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Turner, to whom I offered £50 out of my own purse for one year, and the benefit of a Clerk’s allowance beside, which he thanked me for; but I find he hath some design yet in his head, which I could not think of. In the afternoon my heart was quite pulled down, by being told that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlow was to enquire today for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry; but at night I met with my Lord, who told me that I need not fear, for he would get me the place against the world. And when I came to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe, he told me that <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Petty had been with my Lord, and did tell him that Barlow was a sickly man, and did not intend to execute the place himself, which put me in great comfort again. Till 2 in the morning writing letters and things for my Lord to send to sea. So home to my wife to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-14">4th</time>. Up very early in the morning and landing my wife at White Friars stairs, I went to the Bridge and so to the Treasurer’s of the Navy, with whom I spake about the business of my office, who put me into very good hopes of my business. At his house comes Commissioner Pett, and he and I went to view the houses in Seething Lane, belonging to the Navy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-584" id="noteref-584" epub:type="noteref">584</a> where I find the worst very good, and had great fears in my mind that they will shuffle me out of them, which troubles me. From thence to the Excise Office<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-585" id="noteref-585" epub:type="noteref">585</a> in Broad Street, where I received £500 for my Lord, by appointment of the Treasurer, and went afterwards down with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Luddyard and drank my morning draft with him and other officers. Thence to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Backewell’s, the goldsmith, where I took my Lord’s £100 in plate for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Secretary Nicholas, and my own piece of plate, being a state dish and cup in chased work for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, cost me above £19. Carried these and the money by coach to my Lord’s at Whitehall, and from thence carried Nicholas’s plate to his house and left it there, intending to speak with him anon. So to Westminster Hall, where meeting with <abbr>M.</abbr> L’Impertinent and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Bowyer, I took them to the Sun Tavern, and gave them a lobster and some wine, and sat talking like a fool till 4 o’clock. So to my Lord’s, and walking all the afternoon in Whitehall Court, in expectation of what shall be done in the Council as to our business. It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare, to see the King looking out of the Council window. At night my Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power to act, are granted by the Council. At which he and I were very glad. Home and to bed, my boy lying in my house this night the first time.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-15">5th</time>. This morning my brother Tom brought me my jackanapes coat with silver buttons. It rained this morning, which makes us fear that the glory of this great day will be lost; the King and Parliament being to be entertained by the City today with great pomp.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-586" id="noteref-586" epub:type="noteref">586</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater was with me today, and I agreed with him to be my clerk.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-587" id="noteref-587" epub:type="noteref">587</a> Being at Whitehall, I saw the King, the Dukes, and all their attendants go forth in the rain to the City, and it bedraggled many a fine suit of clothes. I was forced to walk all the morning in Whitehall, not knowing how to get out because of the rain. Met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooling,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-588" id="noteref-588" epub:type="noteref">588</a> my Lord Chamberlain’s secretary, who took me to dinner among the gentlemen waiters, and after dinner into the wine-cellar. He told me how he had a project for all us Secretaries to join together, and get money by bringing all business into our hands. Thence to the Admiralty, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blackburne and I (it beginning to hold up) went and walked an hour or two in the Park, he giving of me light in many things in my way in this office that I go about. And in the evening I got my present of plate carried to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry’s. At my Lord’s at night comes <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Petty to me, to tell me that Barlow had come to town, and other things, which put me into a despair, and I went to bed very sad.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-16">6th</time>. In the morning with my Lord at Whitehall, got the order of the Council for us to act. From thence to Westminster Hall, and there met with the Doctor that showed us so much kindness at the Hague, and took him to the Sun Tavern, and drank with him. So to my Lord’s and dined with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe and Sarah, thinking it might be the last time that I might dine with them together. In the afternoon my Lord and I, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, went and took possession of the Navy Office, whereby my mind was a little cheered, but my hopes not great. From thence Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret and I to the Treasurer’s Office, where he set some things in order. And so home, calling upon Sir Geoffry Palmer, who did give me advice about my patent, which put me to some doubt to know what to do, Barlow being alive. Afterwards called at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pim’s, about getting me a coat of velvet, and he took me to the Half Moon, and the house so full that we stayed above half an hour before we could get anything. So to my Lord’s, where in the dark <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe and I did sing extempories, and I find by use that we are able to sing a bass and a treble pretty well. So home, and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-17">7th</time>. To my Lord, one with me to buy a Clerk’s place, and I did demand £100. To the Council Chamber, where I took an order for the advance of the salaries of the officers of the Navy, and I find mine to be raised to £350 per annum.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-589" id="noteref-589" epub:type="noteref">589</a> Thence to the ’Change, where I bought two fine prints of Ragotti from Rubens, and afterwards dined with my Uncle and Aunt Wight, where her sister Cox and her husband were. After that to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson’s with my uncle, and thence to the Navy Office, where I began to take an inventory of the papers, and goods, and books of the office. To my Lord’s, late writing letters. So home to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-18">8th (Lord’s day)</time>. To Whitehall Chapel, where I got in with ease by going before the Lord Chancellor with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps. Here I heard very good music, the first time that ever I remember to have heard the organs and singing-men in surplices in my life.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-590" id="noteref-590" epub:type="noteref">590</a> The Bishop of Chichester<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-591" id="noteref-591" epub:type="noteref">591</a> preached before the King, and made a great flattering sermon, which I did not like that Clergy should meddle with matters of state. Dined with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Luellin and Salisbury<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-592" id="noteref-592" epub:type="noteref">592</a> at a cook’s shop. Home, and stayed all the afternoon with my wife till after sermon. There till <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fairebrother came to call us out to my father’s to supper. He told me how he had perfectly procured me to be made Master in Arts by proxy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-593" id="noteref-593" epub:type="noteref">593</a> which did somewhat please me, though I remember my cousin Roger Pepys was the other day persuading me from it. While we were at supper came <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Howe to supper to us, and after supper went home to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-19">9th</time>. All the morning at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Palmer’s advising about getting my bill drawn. From thence to the Navy office, where in the afternoon we met and sat, and there I begun to sign bills in the Office the first time. From thence Captain Holland and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Browne of Harwich took me to a tavern and did give me a collation. From thence to the Temple to further my bills being done, and so home to my Lord, and thence to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-20">10th</time>. This day I put on first my new silk suit, the first that ever I wore in my life. This morning came Nan Pepys’ husband <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hall to see me being lately come to town. I had never seen him before. I took him to the Swan tavern with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eglin and there drank our morning draft. Home, and called my wife, and took her to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Clodius’s to a great wedding of Nan Hartlib to Mynheer Roder, which was kept at Goring House<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-594" id="noteref-594" epub:type="noteref">594</a> with very great state, cost, and noble company. But, among all the beauties there, my wife was thought the greatest. After dinner I left the company, and carried my wife to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s. I went to the Attorney-General’s, and had my bill which cost me seven pieces.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-595" id="noteref-595" epub:type="noteref">595</a> I called my wife, and set her home. And finding my Lord in Whitehall Garden, I got him to go to the Secretary’s, which he did, and desired the dispatch of his and my bills to be signed by the King. His bill is to be Earl of Sandwich, Viscount Hinchingbroke, and Baron of <abbr>St.</abbr> Neot’s.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-596" id="noteref-596" epub:type="noteref">596</a> Home, with my mind pretty quiet: not returning, as I said I would, to see the bride put to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-21" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-21">11th</time>. With Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn by water to the Navy office, where we met, and dispatched business. And that being done, we went all to dinner to the Dolphin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-597" id="noteref-597" epub:type="noteref">597</a> upon Major Brown’s invitation. After that to the office again, where I was vexed, and so was Commissioner Pett, to see a busy fellow come to look out the best lodgings for my Lord Barkley,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-598" id="noteref-598" epub:type="noteref">598</a> and the combining between him and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn; and, indeed, was troubled much at it. Home to Whitehall, and took out my bill signed by the King, and carried it to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Watkins of the Privy Seal to be despatched there, and going home to take a cap, I borrowed a pair of sheets of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Howe, and by coach went to the Navy office, and lay (<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater, my clerk, with me) at Commissioner Willoughby’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-599" id="noteref-599" epub:type="noteref">599</a> house, where I was received by him very civilly and slept well.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1660-7-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-22">12th</time>. Up early and by coach to Whitehall with Commissioner Pett, where, after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my bill perfected there, and at the Signet: and then to the House of Lords, and met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps, who directed me to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beale to get my patent engrossed; but he not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks’ Office<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-600" id="noteref-600" epub:type="noteref">600</a> but could find none that could write the hand, that were at leisure. And so in a despair went to the Admiralty, where we met the first time there, my Lord Montagu,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-601" id="noteref-601" epub:type="noteref">601</a> my Lord Barkley, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and all the rest of the principal Officers and Commissioners, [except] only the Controller, who is not yet chosen. At night to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps’s lodgings, but not finding him, I went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spong’s and there I found him and got him to come to me to my Lord’s lodgings at 11 o’clock of night, when I got him to take my bill to write it himself (which was a great providence that he could do it) against tomorrow morning. I late writing letters to sea by the post, and so home to bed. In great trouble because I heard at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beale’s today that Barlow had been there and said that he would make a stop in the business.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1660-7-23" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-23">13th</time>. Up early, the first day that I put on my black camlett coat with silver buttons. To <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spong, whom I found in his nightgown writing of my patent, and he had done as far as he could “for that <abbr>etc.</abbr>” by 8 o’clock. It being done, we carried it to Worcester House<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-602" id="noteref-602" epub:type="noteref">602</a> to the Chancellor, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps (a strange providence that he should now be in a condition to do me a kindness, which I never thought him capable of doing for me), got me the Chancellor’s recepi to my bill; and so carried it to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beale for a dockett; but he was very angry, and unwilling to do it, because he said it was ill writ (because I had got it writ by another hand, and not by him); but by much importunity I got <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spong to go to his office and make an end of my patent; and in the meantime <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beale to be preparing my dockett, which being done, I did give him two pieces, after which it was strange how civil and tractable he was to me. From thence I went to the Navy office, where we despatched much business, and resolved of the houses for the Officers and Commissioners, which I was glad of, and I got leave to have a door made me into the leads. From thence, much troubled in mind about my patent, I went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beale again, who had now finished my patent and made it ready for the Seal, about an hour after I went to meet him at the Chancellor’s. So I went away towards Westminster, and in my way met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spong, and went with him to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lilly and ate some bread and cheese, and drank with him, who still would be giving me council of getting my patent out, for fear of another change, and my Lord Montagu’s fall. After that to Worcester House, where by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps’s means, and my pressing in General Montagu’s name to the Chancellor, I did, beyond all expectation, get my seal passed; and while it was doing in one room, I was forced to keep Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret (who by chance met me there, ignorant of my business) in talk, while it was a doing. Went home and brought my wife with me into London, and some money, with which I paid <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beale £9 in all, and took my patent of him and went to my wife again, whom I had left in a coach at the door of Hinde Court, and presented her with my patent at which she was overjoyed; so to the Navy office, and showed her my house, and were both mightily pleased at all things there, and so to my business. So home with her, leaving her at her mother’s door. I to my Lord’s, where I dispatched an order for a ship to fetch Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Honywood home, for which I got two pieces of my Lady Honywood by young <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Powell. Late writing letters; and great doings of music at the next house, which was Whally’s; the King and Dukes there with Madame Palmer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-603" id="noteref-603" epub:type="noteref">603</a> a pretty woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold. Here at the old door that did go into his lodgings, my Lord, I, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe, did stand listening a great while to the music. After that home to bed. This day I should have been at Guildhall to have borne witness for my brother Hawly against Black Collar, but I could not, at which I was troubled. To bed with the greatest quiet of mind that I have had a great while, having ate nothing but a bit of bread and cheese at Lilly’s today, and a bit of bread and butter after I was abed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-24" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-24">14th</time>. Up early and advised with my wife for the putting of all our things in a readiness to be sent to our new house. To my Lord’s, where he was in bed very late. So with Major Tollhurst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-604" id="noteref-604" epub:type="noteref">604</a> and others to Harper’s, and I sent for my barrel of pickled oysters and there ate them; while we were doing so, comes in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pagan Fisher,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-605" id="noteref-605" epub:type="noteref">605</a> the poet, and promises me what he had long ago done, a book in praise of the King of France, with my armes, and a dedication to me very handsome. After him comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply come from sea yesterday, whom I was glad to see that he may ease me of the trouble of my Lord’s business. So to my Lord’s, where I stayed doing his business and taking his commands. After that to Westminster Hall, where I paid all my debts in order to my going away from hence. Here I met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eglin, who would needs take me to the Leg in King Street and gave me a dish of meat to dinner; and so I sent for <abbr>Mons.</abbr> L’Impertinent, where we sat long and were merry. After that parted, and I took <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Butler [<abbr>Mons.</abbr> L’Impertinent] with me into London by coach and showed him my house at the Navy Office, and did give order for the laying in coals. So into Fenchurch Street, and did give him a glass of wine at Rawlinson’s, and was trimmed in the street. So to my Lord’s late writing letters, and so home, where I found my wife had packed up all her goods in the house fit for a removal. So to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-25" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-25">15th</time>. Lay long in bed to recover my rest. Going forth met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply, and went and drank my morning draft with him at Wilkinson’s, and my brother Spicer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-606" id="noteref-606" epub:type="noteref">606</a> After that to Westminster Abbey, and in Henry the Seventh’s Chapel heard part of a sermon, the first that ever I heard there. To my Lord’s and dined all alone at the table with him. After dinner he and I alone fell to discourse, and I find him plainly to be a sceptic in all things of religion, and to make no great matter of anything therein, but to be a perfect Stoic. In the afternoon to Henry the Seventh’s Chapel, where I heard service and a sermon there, and after that meeting <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Bowyer there, he and I to the Park, and walked a good while till night. So to Harper’s and drank together, and Captain Stokes came to us and so I fell into discourse of buying paper at the first hand in my office, and the Captain promised me to buy it for me in France. After that to my Lord’s lodgings, where I wrote some business and so home. My wife at home all the day, she having no clothes out, all being packed up yesterday. For this month I have wholly neglected anything of news, and so have beyond belief been ignorant how things go, but now by my patent my mind is in some quiet, which God keep. I was not at my father’s today, I being afraid to go for fear he should still solicit me to speak to my Lord for a place in the Wardrobe, which I dare not do, because of my own business yet. My wife and I mightily pleased with our new house that we hope to have. My patent has cost me a great deal of money, about £40, which is the only thing at present which do trouble me much. In the afternoon to Henry the Seventh’s chapel, where I heard a sermon and spent (God forgive me) most of my time in looking upon <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Butler. After that with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Bowyer to walk in the Park. Afterwards to my Lord’s lodgings, and so home to bed, having not been at my father’s today.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-26">16th.</time> This morning it proved very rainy weather so that I could not remove my goods to my house. I to my office and did business there, and so home, it being then sunrise, but by the time that I got to my house it began to rain again, so that I could not carry my goods by cart as I would have done. After that to my Lord’s and so home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-7-27" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-07-27">17th</time>. This morning (as indeed all the mornings nowadays) much business at my Lord’s. There came to my house before I went out <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlow, an old consumptive man, and fair conditioned, with whom I did discourse a great while, and after much talk I did grant him what he asked, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, £50 per annum, if my salary be not increased, and £100 per annum, in case it be to £350, at which he was very well pleased to be paid as I received my money and not otherwise. Going to my Lord’s I found my Lord had got a great cold and kept his bed, and so I brought him to my Lord’s bedside, and he and I did agree together to this purpose what I should allow him. That done and the day proving fair I went home and got all my goods packed up and sent away, and my wife and I and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt went by coach, overtaking the carts a-drinking in the Strand. Being come to my house and set in the goods, and at night sent my wife and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt to buy something for supper; they bought a Quarter of Lamb, and so we ate it, but it was not half roasted. Will,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-607" id="noteref-607" epub:type="noteref">607</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blackburne’s nephew, is so obedient, that I am greatly glad of him. At night he and I and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt home by water to Westminster. I to my Lord, and after having done some business with him in his chamber in the Nursery, which has been now his chamber since he came from sea, I went on foot with a linkboy to my home, where I found my wife in bed and Jane washing the house, and Will the boy sleeping, and a great deal of sport I had before I could wake him. I to bed the first night that I ever lay here with my wife.</p>

This morning we met at the office: I dined at my house in Seething Lane, and after that, going about 4 o’clock to Westminster, I met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carter and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke coming to see me in a coach, and so I returned home. I did also meet with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, the surgeon, with a porter with him, with a barrel of Lemons, which my man Burr sends me from sea. I took all these people home to my house and did give them some drink, and after them comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply, and after a little stay we all went by water to Westminster as far as the New Exchange.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-608" id="noteref-608" epub:type="noteref">608</a> Thence to my Lord about business, and being in talk in comes one with half a buck from Hinchinbroke, and it smelling a little strong my Lord did give it me (though it was as good as any could be). I did carry it to my mother, where I had not been a great while, and indeed had no great mind to go, because my father did lay upon me continually to do him a kindness at the Wardrobe, which I could not do because of my own business being so fresh with my Lord. But my father was not at home, and so I did leave the venison with her to dispose of as she pleased. After that home, where <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer now was, and did lie this night with us, the first night. My mind very quiet, only a little trouble I have for the great debts which I have still upon me to the Secretary, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spong for my patent.</p>

I and my wife by water, landed her at Whitefriars with her boy with an iron of our new range which is already broke and my wife will have changed, and many other things she has to buy with the help of my father today. I to my Lord and found him in bed. This day I received my commission to swear people the oath of allegiance and supremacy delivered me by my Lord.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-609" id="noteref-609" epub:type="noteref">609</a> After talk with my Lord I went to Westminster Hall, where I took <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Michell and his wife, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Murford we sent for afterwards, to the Dog Tavern, where I did give them a dish of anchovies and olives and paid for all, and did talk of our old discourse when we did use to talk of the King, in the time of the Rump, privately; after that to the Admiralty Office, in Whitehall, where I stayed and writ my last observations for these four days last past. Great talk of the difference between the Episcopal and Presbyterian Clergy, but I believe it will come to nothing. So home and to bed.</p>

After we rose at the office, I went to my father’s, where my Uncle Fenner and all his crew and Captain Holland and his wife and my wife were at dinner at a venison pasty of the venison that I did give my mother the other day. I did this time show so much coldness to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Joyce that I believe all the table took notice of it.

Afterwards I went out and looked into several churches, and so to my uncle Fenner’s, whither my wife was got before me, and we, my father and mother, and all the Joyces, and my aunt Bell, whom I had not seen many a year before. After dinner to Whitehall (my wife to church with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">K.</abbr> Joyce), where I find my Lord at home, and walked in the garden with him, he showing me all the respect that can be.

He urged to have these words (in consideration whereof) to be interlined, which I granted, though against my will. Met this morning at the office, and afterwards <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barlow by appointment came and dined with me, and both of us very pleasant and pleased. After dinner to my Lord, who took me to Secretary Nicholas, and there before him and Secretary Morris,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-614" id="noteref-614" epub:type="noteref">614</a> my Lord and I upon our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and the Oath of the Privy Seal, of which I was much glad, though I am not likely to get anything by it at present; but I do desire it, for fear of a turnout of our office. That done and my Lord gone from me, I went with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooling and his brother, and Sam Hartlibb, little Jennings and some others to the King’s Head Tavern at Charing Cross, where after drinking I took boat and so home, where we supped merrily among ourselves (our little boy proving a droll) and so after prayers to bed. This day my Lord had heard that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barnwell was dead, but it is not so yet, though he be very ill.

In the afternoon I spent much time in walking in Whitehall Court with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bickerstaffe, who was very glad of my Lord’s being sworn, because of his business with his brother Baron,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-615" id="noteref-615" epub:type="noteref">615</a> which is referred to my Lord Chancellor, and to be ended tomorrow.

After we had drunk hard we parted, and I went away and met <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Castle, who is one of the Clerks of the Privy Seal, and told him how things were with my Lord and me, which he received very gladly. I was this day told how Baron against all expectation and law has got the place of Bickerstaffe, and so I question whether he will not lay claim to wait the next month, but my Lord tells me that he will stand for it.
