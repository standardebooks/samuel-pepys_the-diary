			<article id="entry-1668-3-11" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-03-11">March 1st (Lord’s day)</time>. Up very betimes, and by coach to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s; and there, largely carrying with me all my notes and papers, did run over our whole defence in the business of tickets, in order to the answering the House on Thursday next; and I do think, unless they be set without reason to ruin us, we shall make a good defence. I find him in great anxiety, though he will not discover it, in the business of the proceedings of Parliament; and would as little as is possible have his name mentioned in our discourse to them; and particularly the business of selling places is now upon his hand to defend himself in; wherein I did help him in his defence about the flag-maker’s place, which is named in the House. We did here do the like about the complaint of want of victuals in the fleet in the year 1666, which will lie upon me to defend also. So that my head is full of care and weariness in my employment. Thence home, and there my mind being a little lightened by my morning’s work in the arguments I have now laid together in better method for our defence to the Parliament, I to talk with my wife; and in lieu of a coach this year, I have got my wife to be contented with her closet being made up this summer, and going into the country this summer for a month or two, to my father’s, and there Mercer and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> and Jane shall go with her, which I the rather do for the entertaining my wife, and preventing of fallings out between her and my father or <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>, which uses to be the fate of her going into the country. After dinner by coach to Westminster, and there to <abbr>St.</abbr> Margaret’s church, thinking to have seen Betty Michell, but she was not there, but met her father and mother and with them to her father’s house, where I never was before, but was mighty much made of, with some good strong waters, which they have from their son Michell, and mighty good people they are. Thence to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, where I have not been also a good while, and with great difficulty, company being there, did get an opportunity to <i xml:lang="fr">hazer</i> what I would <i xml:lang="es">con</i> her, and here I was mightily taken with a starling which she hath, that was the King’s, which he kept in his bedchamber; and do whistle and talk the most and best that ever I heard anything in my life. Thence to visit Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly, who continues still sick of his cold, and thence calling, but in vain, to speak with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret at his house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where I spoke with nobody, but home, where spent the evening talking with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer about business of the House, and declaring my expectation of all our being turned out. Hither comes Carcasse to me about business, and there did confess to me of his own accord his having heretofore discovered as a complaint against Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and me that we did prefer the paying of some men to man <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">The Flying Greyhound</i> to others, by order under our hands. The thing upon recollection I believe is true, and do hope no great matter can be made of it, but yet I would be glad to have my name out of it, which I shall labour to do; in the meantime it weighs as a new trouble on my mind, and did trouble me all night. So without supper to bed, my eyes being also a little overwrought of late that I could not stay up to read.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-12">2nd</time>. Up and betimes to the office, where I did much business, and several come to me, and among others I did prepare <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Warren, and by and by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden, about what presents I have had from them, that they may not publish them, or if they do, that in truth I received none on the account of the Navy but Tangier, and this is true to the former, and in both that I never asked anything of them. I must do the like with the rest. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore was with me, and he do tell me, and so <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer tells me, he hears this morning that all the town is full of the discourse that the Officers of the Navy shall be all turned out, but honest Sir John Minnes, who, God knows, is fitter to have been turned out himself than any of us, doing the King more hurt by his dotage and folly than all the rest can do by their knavery, if they had a mind to it. At noon home to dinner, where was Mercer, and very merry as I could be with my mind so full of business, and so with my wife, her and the girl, to the King’s house to see the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Virgin Martyr</i> again, which do mightily please me, but above all the music at the coming down of the angel, which at this hearing the second time, do still commend me as nothing ever did, and the other music is nothing to it. Thence with my wife to the ’Change, and so, calling at the Cocke ale house, we home, and there I settle to business, and with my people preparing my great answer to the Parliament for the office about tickets till past 12 o’clock at night, and then home to supper and to bed, keeping <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gibson all night with me. This day I have the news that my sister was married on Thursday last to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jackson; so that work is, I hope, well over.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-13">3rd</time>. Up betimes to work again, and then met at the Office, where to our great business of this answer to the Parliament; where to my great vexation I find my Lord Brouncker prepared only to excuse himself, while I, that have least reason to trouble myself, am preparing with great pains to defend them all: and more, I perceive, he would lodge the beginning of discharging ships by ticket upon me; but I care not, for I believe I shall get more honour by it when the Parliament, against my will, shall see how the whole business of the Office was done by me. At noon rose and to dinner. My wife abroad with Mercer and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> buying of things, but I with my clerks home to dinner, and thence presently down with Lord Brouncker, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Harvy, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Middleton, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tippets,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3928" id="noteref-3928" epub:type="noteref">3928</a> who first took his place this day at the table, as a Commissioner, in the room of Commissioner Pett. Down by water to Deptford, where the King, Queen, and Court are to see launched the new ship built by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shish, called <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">The Charles</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3929" id="noteref-3929" epub:type="noteref">3929</a> God send her better luck than the former! Here some of our brethren, who went in a boat a little before my boat, did by appointment take opportunity of asking the King’s leave that we might make full use of the want of money, in our excuse to the Parliament for the business of tickets, and other things they will lay to our charge, all which arose from nothing else: and this the King did readily agree to, and did give us leave to make our full use of it. The ship being well launched, I back again by boat, setting [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Middleton and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tippets on shore at Ratcliffe, I home and there to my chamber with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gibson, and late up till midnight preparing more things against our defence on Thursday next to my content, though vexed that all this trouble should be on me. So to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1668-3-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-03-14">4th</time>. Up betimes and with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn in his coach to Whitehall, there to wait upon the Duke of York and the Commissioners of the Treasury, [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry and Sir John Duncombe, who do declare that they cannot find the money we demand, and we that less than what we demand will not set out the fleet intended, and so broke up, with no other conclusion than that they would let us have what they could get and we would improve that as well as we could. So God bless us, and prepare us against the consequences of these matters. Thence, it being a cold wet day, I home with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes in his coach, and called by the way at my bookseller’s and took home with me Kercher’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Musurgia</i>⁠—very well bound, but I had no comfort to look upon them, but as soon as I come home fell to my work at the office, shutting the doors, that we, I and my clerks, might not be interrupted, and so, only with room for a little dinner, we very busy all the day till night that the officers met for me to give them the heads of what I intended to say, which I did with great discontent to see them all rely on me that have no reason at all to trouble myself about it, nor have any thanks from them for my labour, but contrarily Brouncker looked mighty dogged, as thinking that I did not intend to do it so as to save him. This troubled me so much as, together with the shortness of the time and muchness of the business, did let me be at it till but about ten at night, and then quite weary, and dull, and vexed, I could go no further, but resolved to leave the rest to tomorrow morning, and so in full discontent and weariness did give over and went home, with[out] supper vexed and sickish to bed, and there slept about three hours, but then waked, and never in so much trouble in all my life of mind, thinking of the task I have upon me, and upon what dissatisfactory grounds, and what the issue of it may be to me.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1668-3-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-03-15">5th</time>. With these thoughts I lay troubling myself till six o’clock, restless, and at last getting my wife to talk to me to comfort me, which she at last did, and made me resolve to quit my hands of this Office, and endure the trouble of it no longer than till I can clear myself of it. So with great trouble, but yet with some ease, from this discourse with my wife, I up, and to my Office, whither come my clerks, and so I did huddle the best I could some more notes for my discourse today, and by nine o’clock was ready, and did go down to the Old Swan, and there by boat, with <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">T. H</abbr>[ater] and <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">W. H</abbr>[ewer] with me, to Westminster, where I found myself come time enough, and my brethren all ready. But I full of thoughts and trouble touching the issue of this day; and, to comfort myself, did go to the Dog and drink half-a-pint of mulled sack, and in the Hall [Westminster] did drink a dram of brandy at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hewlett’s; and with the warmth of this did find myself in better order as to courage, truly. So we all up to the lobby; and between eleven and twelve o’clock, were called in, with the mace before us, into the House, where a mighty full House; and we stood at the bar, namely, Brouncker, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Harvey, and myself, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn being in the House, as a Member. I perceive the whole House was full, and full of expectation of our defence what it would be, and with great prejudice. After the Speaker had told us the dissatisfaction of the House, and read the Report of the Committee, I began our defence most acceptably and smoothly, and continued at it without any hesitation or losse, but with full scope, and all my reason free about me, as if it had been at my own table, from that time till past three in the afternoon; and so ended, without any interruption from the Speaker; but we withdrew. And there all my Fellow-Officers, and all the world that was within hearing, did congratulate me, and cry up my speech as the best thing they ever heard; and my Fellow-Officers overjoyed in it; we were called in again by and by to answer only one question, touching our paying tickets to ticket-mongers; and so out; and we were in hopes to have had a vote this day in our favour, and so the generality of the House was; but my speech, being so long, many had gone out to dinner and come in again half drunk; and then there are two or three that are professed enemies to us and everybody else; among others, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Littleton, Sir Thomas Lee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3930" id="noteref-3930" epub:type="noteref">3930</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wiles, the coxcomb whom I saw heretofore at the cockfighting, and a few others; I say, these did rise up and speak against the coming to a vote now, the House not being full, by reason of several being at dinner, but most because that the House was to attend the King this afternoon, about the business of religion, wherein they pray him to put in force all the laws against Nonconformists and Papists; and this prevented it, so that they put it off to tomorrow come se’nnight. However, it is plain we have got great ground; and everybody says I have got the most honour that any could have had opportunity of getting; and so with our hearts mightily overjoyed at this success, we all to dinner to Lord Brouncker’s⁠—that is to say, myself, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Harvey, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and there dined; and thence with Sir Anthony Morgan, who is an acquaintance of Brouncker’s, a very wise man, we after dinner to the King’s house, and there saw part of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Discontented Colonel</i>, but could take no great pleasure in it, because of our coming in in the middle of it. After the play, home with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and there to my wife, whom <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer had told of my success, and she overjoyed, and I also as to my particular; and, after talking awhile, I betimes to bed, having had no quiet rest a good while.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-16">6th</time>. Up betimes, and with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s chamber: where the first word he said to me was, “Good-morrow, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys, that must be Speaker of the Parliament-house:” and did protest I had got honour forever in Parliament. He said that his brother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3931" id="noteref-3931" epub:type="noteref">3931</a> that sat by him, admires me; and another gentleman said that I could not get less than £1,000 a-year if I would put on a gown and plead at the Chancery-bar; but, what pleases me most, he tells me that the Solicitor-General<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3932" id="noteref-3932" epub:type="noteref">3932</a> did protest that he thought I spoke the best of any man in England. After several talks with him alone, touching his own businesses, he carried me to Whitehall, and there parted; and I to the Duke of York’s lodgings, and find him going to the Park, it being a very fine morning, and I after him; and, as soon as he saw me, he told me, with great satisfaction, that I had converted a great many yesterday, and did, with great praise of me, go on with the discourse with me. And, by and by, overtaking the King, the King and Duke of York come to me both; and he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3933" id="noteref-3933" epub:type="noteref">3933</a> said, “<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys, I am very glad of your success yesterday;” and fell to talk of my well speaking; and many of the Lords there. My Lord Barkeley did cry the up for what they had heard of it; and others, Parliament-men there, about the King, did say that they never heard such a speech in their lives delivered in that manner. Progers, of the Bedchamber, swore to me afterwards before Brouncker, in the afternoon, that he did tell the King that he thought I might teach the Solicitor-General. Everybody that saw me almost come to me, as Joseph Williamson and others, with such eulogies as cannot be expressed. From thence I went to Westminster Hall, where I met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Montagu, who come to me and kissed me, and told me that he had often heretofore kissed my hands, but now he would kiss my lips: protesting that I was another Cicero, and said, all the world said the same of me. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ashburnham, and every creature I met there of the Parliament, or that knew anything of the Parliament’s actings, did salute me with this honour:⁠—<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godolphin;⁠—<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sands, who swore he would go twenty mile, at any time, to hear the like again, and that he never saw so many sit four hours together to hear any man in his life, as there did to hear me; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chichly⁠—Sir John Duncomb⁠—and everybody do say that the kingdom will ring of my abilities, and that I have done myself right for my whole life: and so Captain Cocke, and others of my friends, say that no man had ever such an opportunity of making his abilities known; and, that I may cite all at once, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lieutenant of the Tower did tell me that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Vaughan did protest to him, and that, in his hearing it, said so to the Duke of Albemarle, and afterwards to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, that he had sat twenty-six years in Parliament and never heard such a speech there before: for which the Lord God make me thankful! and that I may make use of it not to pride and vainglory, but that, now I have this esteem, I may do nothing that may lessen it! I spent the morning thus walking in the Hall, being complimented by everybody with admiration: and at noon stepped into the Legg with Sir William Warren, who was in the Hall, and there talked about a little of his business, and thence into the Hall a little more, and so with him by coach as far as the Temple almost, and there ’light, to follow my Lord Brouncker’s coach, which I spied, and so to Madam Williams’s, where I overtook him, and agreed upon meeting this afternoon, and so home to dinner, and after dinner with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who come to my house to call me, to Whitehall, to wait on the Duke of York, where he again and all the company magnified me, and several in the Gallery: among others, my Lord Gerard, who never knew me before nor spoke to me, desires his being better acquainted with me; and [said] that, at table where he was, he never heard so much said of any man as of me, in his whole life. We waited on the Duke of York, and thence into the Gallery, where the House of Lords waited the King’s coming out of the Park, which he did by and by; and there, in the Vane-room, my Lord Keeper delivered a message to the King, the Lords being about him, wherein the Barons of England, from many good arguments, very well expressed in the part he read out of, do demand precedence in England of all noblemen of either of the King’s other two kingdoms, be their title what it will; and did show that they were in England reputed but as Commoners, and sat in the House of Commons, and at conferences with the Lords did stand bare. It was mighty worth my hearing: but the King did only say that he would consider of it, and so dismissed them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3934" id="noteref-3934" epub:type="noteref">3934</a> Thence Brouncker and I to the Committee of Miscarriages sitting in the Court of Wards, expecting with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden to have been heard against Prince Rupert’s complaints for want of victuals. But the business of Holmes’s charge against Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jer.</abbr> Smith, which is a most shameful scandalous thing for Flag officers to accuse one another of, and that this should be heard here before men that understand it not at all, and after it hath been examined and judged in before the King and Lord High Admiral and other able seamen to judge, it is very hard. But this business did keep them all the afternoon, so we not heard but put off to another day. Thence, with the Lieutenant of the Tower, in his coach home; and there, with great pleasure, with my wife, talking and playing at cards a little⁠—she, and I, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>, and so, after a little supper, I to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-17">7th</time>. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, at noon home to dinner, where Mercer with us, and after dinner she, my wife, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>, and I, to the King’s playhouse, and there saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Spanish Gypsies</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3935" id="noteref-3935" epub:type="noteref">3935</a> the second time of acting, and the first that I saw it. A very silly play, only great variety of dances, and those most excellently done, especially one part by one Hanes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3936" id="noteref-3936" epub:type="noteref">3936</a> only lately come thither from the Nursery, an understanding fellow, but yet, they say, hath spent £1,000 a-year before he come thither. This day my wife and I full of thoughts about <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s sending me word that she, and my old company, Harris and Knipp, would come and dine with us next Wednesday, how we should do⁠—to receive or put them off, my head being, at this time, so full of business, and my wife in no mind to have them neither, and yet I desire it. Come to no resolution tonight. Home from the playhouse to the office, where I wrote what I had to write, and among others to my father to congratulate my sister’s marriage, and so home to supper a little and then to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-18">8th (Lord’s day)</time>. At my sending to desire it, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, did call me with his coach, and carried me to Whitehall, where met with very many people still that did congratulate my speech the other day in the House of Commons, and I find all the world almost rings of it. Here spent the morning walking and talking with one or other, and among the rest with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, who I find full of care in his own business, how to defend himself against those that have a mind to choke him; and though, I believe, not for honour and for the keeping his employment, but for his safety and reputation’s sake, is desirous to preserve himself free from blame, and among other mean ways which himself did take notice to me to be but a mean thing he desires me to get information against Captain Tatnell, thereby to diminish his testimony, who, it seems, hath a mind to do <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry hurt: and I will do it with all my heart; for Tatnell is a very rogue. He would be glad, too, that I could find anything proper for his taking notice against Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.</abbr> Hollis. At noon, after sermon, I to dinner with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where I find mighty deal of company⁠—a solemn day for some of his and her friends, and dine in the great dining-room above stairs, where Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret himself, and I, and his son, at a little table by, the great table being full of strangers. Here my Lady <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jem.</abbr> do promise to come, and bring my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady some day this week, to dinner to me, which I am glad of. After dinner, I up with her husband, Sir Philip Carteret, to his closet, where, beyond expectation, I do find many pretty things, wherein he appears to be ingenious, such as in painting, and drawing, and making of watches, and such kind of things, above my expectation; though, when all is done, he is a shirke, who owns his owing me £10 for his lady two or three years ago, and yet cannot provide to pay me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3937" id="noteref-3937" epub:type="noteref">3937</a> The company by and by parted, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret and I to Whitehall, where I set him down and took his coach as far as the Temple, it raining, and there took a hackney and home, and so had my head combed, and then to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1668-3-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-03-19">9th</time>. Up betimes, and anon with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Warren, who come to speak with me, by coach to Whitehall, and there met Lord Brouncker: and he and I to the Commissioners of the Treasury, where I find them mighty kind to me, more, I think, than was wont. And here I also met Colvill, the goldsmith; who tells me, with great joy, how the world upon the ’Change talks of me; and how several Parliamentmen, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, Boscawen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3938" id="noteref-3938" epub:type="noteref">3938</a> and Major [Lionel] Walden, of Huntingdon, who, it seems, do deal with him, do say how bravely I did speak, and that the House was ready to have given me thanks for it; but that, I think, is a vanity. Thence I with Lord Brouncker, and did take up his mistress, Williams, and so to the ’Change, only to show myself, and did a little business there, and so home to dinner, and then to the office busy till the evening, and then to the Excize Office, where I find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ball in a mighty trouble that he is to be put out of his place at Midsummer, the whole Commission being to cease, and the truth is I think they are very fair dealing men, all of them. Here I did do a little business, and then to rights home, and there dispatched many papers, and so home late to supper and to bed, being eased of a great many thoughts, and yet have a great many more to remove as fast as I can, my mind being burdened with them, having been so much employed upon the public business of the office in their defence before the Parliament of late, and the further cases that do attend it.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-20">10th</time>. Up, and to the office betimes, where all the morning. At noon home to dinner with my clerks, and after dinner comes Kate Joyce, who tells me she is putting off her house, which I am glad of, but it was pleasant that she come on purpose to me about getting a ticket paid, and in her way hither lost her ticket, so that she is at a great loss what to do. There comes in then <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mercer, the mother, the first time she has been here since her daughter lived with us, to see my wife, and after a little talk I left them and to the office, and thence with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden to Westminster Hall, thinking to have attended the Committee about the Victualling business, but they did not meet, but here we met Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Brookes, who do mightily cry up my speech the other day, saying my fellow-officers are obliged to me, as indeed they are. Thence with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden homewards, calling at Lincolne’s Inn Fields: but my Lady Jemimah was not within: and so to Newgate, where he stopped to give directions to the jaylor about a Knight, one Sir Thomas Halford<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3939" id="noteref-3939" epub:type="noteref">3939</a> brought in yesterday for killing one Colonel Temple, falling out at a tavern. So thence as far as Leadenhall, and there I ’light, and back by coach to Lincoln’s Inn Fields; but my Lady was not come in, and so I am at a great loss whether she and her brother Hinchingbroke and sister will dine with me tomorrow or no, which vexes me. So home; and there comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore to me, who tells me that he fears my Lord Sandwich will meet with very great difficulties to go through about the prizes, it being found that he did give orders for more than the King’s letter do justify; and then for the Act of Resumption, which he fears will go on, and is designed only to do him hurt, which troubles me much. He tells me he believes the Parliament will not be brought to do anything in matters of religion, but will adhere to the Bishops. So he gone, I up to supper, where I find <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Joyce and Harman come to see us, and there was also <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Mercer and her two daughters, and here we were as merry as that fellow Joyce could make us with his mad talking, after the old wont, which tired me. But I was mightily pleased with his singing; for the rogue hath a very good ear, and a good voice. Here he stayed till he was almost drunk, and then away at about ten at night, and then all broke up, and I to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-21">11th</time>. Up, and betimes to the office, where busy till 8 o’clock, and then went forth, and meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Colvill, I walked with, him to his building, where he is building a fine house, where he formerly lived, in Lombard Street: and it will be a very fine street. Thence walked down to the Three Cranes and there took boat to Whitehall, where by direction I waited on the Duke of York about office business, and so by water to Westminster, where walking in the Hall most of the morning, and up to my Lady <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jem.</abbr> in Lincoln’s Inn Fields to get her to appoint the day certain when she will come and dine with me, and she hath appointed Saturday next. So back to Westminster; and there still walked, till by and by comes Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, and with him <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chichly and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Andrew Newport,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3940" id="noteref-3940" epub:type="noteref">3940</a> I to dinner with them to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chichly’s, in Queen Street, in Covent Garden. A very fine house, and a man that lives in mighty great fashion, with all things in a most extraordinary manner noble and rich about him, and eats in the French fashion all; and mighty nobly served with his servants, and very civilly; that I was mighty pleased with it: and good discourse. He is a great defender of the Church of England, and against the Act for Comprehension, which is the work of this day, about which the House is like to sit till night. After dinner, away with them back to Westminster, where, about four o’clock, the House rises, and hath done nothing more in the business than to put off the debate to this day month. In the meantime the King hath put out his proclamations this day, as the House desired, for the putting in execution the Act against Nonconformists and Papists, but yet it is conceived that for all this some liberty must be given, and people will have it. Here I met with my cousin Roger Pepys, who is come to town, and hath been told of my performance before the House the other day, and is mighty proud of it, and Captain Cocke met me here today, and told me that the Speaker says he never heard such a defence made, in all his life, in the House; and that the Solicitor-General do commend me even to envy. I carried cousin Roger as far as the Strand, where, spying out of the coach Colonel Charles George Cocke, formerly a very great man, and my father’s customer, whom I have carried clothes to, but now walks like a poor sorry sneake, he stopped, and I ’light to him. This man knew me, which I would have willingly avoided, so much pride I had, he being a man of mighty height and authority in his time, but now signifies nothing. Thence home, where to the office a while and then home, where <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batelier was and played at cards and supped with us, my eyes being out of order for working, and so to bed.</p>

So after a turn or two with Lord Brouncker, I took my wife up and left her at the ’Change while I to Gresham College, there to show myself; and was there greeted by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Wilkins, Whistler, and others, as the patron of the Navy Office, and one that got great fame by my late speech to the Parliament. Here I saw a great trial of the goodness of a burning glass, made of a new figure, not spherical (by one Smithys, I think, they call him), that did burn a glove of my Lord Brouncker’s from the heat of a very little fire, which a burning glass of the old form, or much bigger, could not do, which was mighty pretty. Here I heard Sir Robert Southwell give an account of some things committed to him by the Society at his going to Portugal, which he did deliver in a mighty handsome manner.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3941" id="noteref-3941" epub:type="noteref">3941</a> Thence went away home, and there at my office as long as my eyes would endure, and then home to supper, and to talk with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pelling, who tells me what a fame I have in the City for my late performance; and upon the whole I bless God for it. I think I have, if I can keep it, done myself a great deal of repute. So by and by to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-23">13th</time>. Up betimes to my office, where to fit myself for attending the Parliament again, not to make any more speech, which, while my fame is good, I will avoid, for fear of losing it; but only to answer to what objections will be made against us. Thence walked to the Old Swan and drank at Michell’s, whose house is going up apace. Here I saw Betty, but could not <i xml:lang="fr">baiser la</i>, and so to Westminster, there to the Hall, where up to my cousin Roger Pepys at the Parliament door, and there he took me aside, and told me how he was taken up by one of the House yesterday, for moving for going on with the King’s supply of money, without regard to the keeping pace therewith, with the looking into miscarriages, and was told by this man privately that it did arise because that he had a kinsman concerned therein; and therefore he would prefer the safety of his kinsman to the good of the nation, and that there was great things against us and against me, for all my fine discourse the other day. But I did bid him be at no pain for me; for I knew of nothing but what I was very well prepared to answer; and so I think I am, and therefore was not at all disquieted by this. Thence he to the House, and I to the Hall, where my Lord Brouncker and the rest waiting till noon and not called for by the House, they being upon the business of money again, and at noon all of us to Chatelin’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3942" id="noteref-3942" epub:type="noteref">3942</a> the French house in Covent Garden, to dinner⁠—Brouncker, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Harvey, and myself⁠—and there had a dinner cost us 8<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> apiece, a damned base dinner, which did not please us at all, so that I am not fond of this house at all, but do rather choose the Beare. After dinner to Whitehall to the Duke of York, and there did our usual business, complaining of our standing still in every-respect for want of money, but no remedy propounded, but so I must still be. Thence with our company to the King’s playhouse, where I left them, and I, my head being full of tomorrow’s dinner, I to my Lord Crew’s, there to invite Sir Thomas Crew; and there met with my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady, the first time I spoke to her. I saluted her; and she mighty civil: and, with my Lady Jemimah, do all resolve to be very merry tomorrow at my house. My Lady Hinchingbroke I cannot say is a beauty, nor ugly; but is altogether a comely lady enough, and seems very good-humoured, and I mighty glad of the occasion of seeing her before tomorrow. Thence home; and there find one laying of my napkins against tomorrow in figures of all sorts, which is mighty pretty; and, it seems, it is his trade, and he gets much money by it; and do now and then furnish tables with plate and linnen for a feast at so much, which is mighty pretty, and a trade I could not have thought of. I find my wife upon the bed not over well, her breast being broke out with heat, which troubles her, but I hope it will be for her good. Thence I to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and did get her to go along with me to the French pewterer’s, and there did buy some new pewter against tomorrow; and thence to Whitehall, to have got a cook of her acquaintance, the best in England, as she says. But after we had with much ado found him, he could not come, nor was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gentleman in town, whom next I would have had, nor would <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stone let her man Lewis come, whom this man recommended to me; so that I was at a mighty loss what in the world to do for a cook, Philips being out of town. Therefore, after staying here at Westminster a great while, we back to London, and there to Philips’s, and his man directed us to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Levett’s, who could not come, and he sent to two more, and they could not; so that, at last, Levett as a great kindness did resolve he would leave his business and come himself, which set me in great ease in my mind, and so home, and there with my wife setting all things in order against tomorrow, having seen <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner at home, and so late to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-24">14th</time>. Up very betimes, and with Jane to Levett’s, there to conclude upon our dinner; and thence to the pewterer’s, to buy a pewter sesterne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3943" id="noteref-3943" epub:type="noteref">3943</a> which I have ever hitherto been without, and so up and down upon several occasions to set matters in order, and that being done I out of doors to Westminster Hall, and there met my Lord Brouncker, who tells me that our business is put off till Monday, and so I was mighty glad that I was eased of my attendance here, and of any occasion that might put me out of humour, as it is likely if we had been called before the Parliament. Therefore, after having spoke with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godolphin and cousin Roger, I away home, and there do find everything in mighty good order, only my wife not dressed, which troubles me. Anon comes my company, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady, Sir Philip Carteret and his lady, Godolphin and my cousin Roger, and Creed: and mighty merry; and by and by to dinner, which was very good and plentifull: (I should have said, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George Montagu), who come at a very little warning, which was exceeding kind of him. And there, among other things, my Lord had Sir Samuel Morland’s late invention for casting up of sums of £ <abbr>s. d.</abbr>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3944" id="noteref-3944" epub:type="noteref">3944</a> which is very pretty, but not very useful. Most of our discourse was of my Lord Sandwich and his family, as being all of us of the family; and with extraordinary pleasure all the afternoon, thus together eating and looking over my closet: and my Lady Hinchingbroke I find a very sweet-natured and well-disposed lady, a lover of books and pictures, and of good understanding. About five o’clock they went; and then my wife and I abroad by coach into Moorefields, only for a little ayre, and so home again, staying nowhere, and then up to her chamber, there to talk with pleasure of this day’s passages, and so to bed. This day I had the welcome news of our prize being come safe from Holland, so as I shall have hopes, I hope, of getting my money of my Lady Batten, or good part of it.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-25">15th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up and walked, it being fine dry weather, to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s, overtaking my boy Ely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3945" id="noteref-3945" epub:type="noteref">3945</a> (that was), and he walked with me, being grown a man, and I think a sober fellow. He parted at Charing Cross, and I to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s, and there talked with him about the Commissioners of Accounts, who did give in their report yesterday to the House, and do lay little upon us as aggravate anything at present, but only do give an account of the dissatisfactory account they receive from Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, which I am sorry for, they saying that he tells them not any time when he paid any sum, which is fit for them to know for the computing of interest, but I fear he is hardly able to tell it. They promise to give them an account of the embezzlement of prizes, wherein I shall be something concerned, but nothing that I am afeard of, I thank God. Thence walked with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry into the Park, and there met the King and the Duke of York, and walked a good while with them: and here met Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jer.</abbr> Smith, who tells me he is like to get the better of Holmes, and that when he is come to an end of that, he will do Hollis’s business for him, in the House, for his blasphemies, which I shall be glad of. So to Whitehall, and there walked with this man and that man till chapel done, and, the King dined and then Sir Thomas Clifford, the Comptroller,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3946" id="noteref-3946" epub:type="noteref">3946</a> took me with him to dinner to his lodgings, where my Lord Arlington and a great deal of good and great company; where I very civilly used by them, and had a most excellent dinner: and good discourse of Spain, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Godolphin being there; particularly of the removal of the bodies of all the dead Kings of Spain that could be got together, and brought to the Pantheon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3947" id="noteref-3947" epub:type="noteref">3947</a> at the Escuriall, when it was finished, and there placed before the altar, there to lie forever; and there was a sermon made to them upon this text, “<i xml:lang="la">Arida ossa, audite verbum Dei</i>;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3948" id="noteref-3948" epub:type="noteref">3948</a> and a most eloquent sermon, as they say, who say they have read it. After dinner, away hence, and I to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, and there spent the afternoon, and did <i xml:lang="fr">hazer con elle</i>, and here was her sister and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Burrows, and so in the evening got a coach and home, and there find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pelling and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer, and there talked and supped, Pelting being gone, and mightily pleased with a picture that <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer brought hither of several things painted upon a deal board, which board is so well painted that in my whole life I never was so well pleased or surprised with any picture, and so troubled that so good pictures should be painted upon a piece of bad deal. Even after I knew that it was not board, but only the picture of a board, I could not remove my fancy. After supper to bed, being very sleepy, and, I bless God, my mind being at very good present rest.</p>

Up, to set my papers and books in order, and put up my plate since my late feast, and then to Westminster, by water, with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater, and there, in the Hall, did walk all the morning, talking with one or other, expecting to have our business in the House; but did now a third time wait to no purpose, they being all this morning upon the business of Barker’s petition about the making void the Act of Settlement in Ireland, which makes a great deal of hot work: and, at last, finding that by all men’s opinion they could not come to our matter today, I with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn home, and there to dinner, where I find, by Willet’s crying, that her mistress had been angry with her: but I would take no notice of it. Busy all the afternoon at the office, and then by coach to the Excize Office, but lost my labour, there being nobody there, and so back again home, and after a little at the office I home, and there spent the evening with my wife talking and singing, and so to bed with my mind pretty well at ease. This evening <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford and I met at the first’s house to talk of our prize that is now at last come safe over from Holland, by which I hope to receive some if not all the benefit of my bargain with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten for my share in it, which if she had miscarried I should have doubted of my Lady Batten being left little able to have paid me.</p>

Up betimes and to the office, where all the morning busy, and then at noon home to dinner, and so again to the office awhile, and then abroad to the Excize-Office, where I met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ball,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3949" id="noteref-3949" epub:type="noteref">3949</a> and did receive the paper I went for; and there fell in talk with him, who, being an old cavalier, do swear and curse at the present state of things, that we should be brought to this, that we must be undone and cannot be saved; that the Parliament is sitting now, and will till midnight, to find how to raise this £300,000, and he doubts they will not do it so as to be seasonable for the King: but do cry out against our great men at Court; how it is a fine thing for a Secretary of State to dance a jigg, and that it was not so heretofore; and, above all, do curse my Lord of Bristoll, saying the worst news that ever he heard in his life, or that the Devil could ever bring us, was this Lord’s coming to prayers the other day in the House of Lords, by which he is coming about again from being a Papist, which will undo this nation; and he says he ever did say, at the King’s first coming in, that this nation could not be safe while that man was alive. Having done there, I away towards Westminster, but seeing by the coaches the House to be up, I stopped at the ’Change (where, I met <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and did give her a pair of gloves), and there bought several things for my wife, and so to my bookseller’s, and there looked for Montaigne’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essays</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3950" id="noteref-3950" epub:type="noteref">3950</a> which I heard by my Lord Arlington and Lord Blaney so much commended, and intend to buy it, but did not now, but home, where at the office did some business, as much as my eyes would give leave, and so home to supper, Mercer with us talking and singing, and so to bed. The House, I hear, have this day concluded upon raising £100,000 of the £300,000 by wine, and the rest by a poll-[tax], and have resolved to excuse the Church, in expectation that they will do the more of themselves at this juncture; and I do hear that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry did make a speech in behalf of the Clergy.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-03-28">18th</time>. Up betimes to Westminster, where met with cousin Roger and Creed and walked with them, and Roger do still continue of the mind that there is no other way of saving this nation but by dissolving this Parliament and calling another; but there are so many about the King that will not be able to stand, if a new Parliament come, that they will not persuade the King to it. I spent most of the morning walking with one or other, and anon met Doll Lane at the Dog tavern, and there <i xml:lang="fr">je</i> did <i xml:lang="fr">hater</i> what I did desire with her⁠ ⁠… and I did give her as being my valentine 20<abbr>s.</abbr> to buy what <i xml:lang="fr">elle</i> would. Thence away by coach to my bookseller’s, and to several places to pay my debts, and to Ducke Lane, and there bought Montaigne’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essays</i>, in English, and so away home to dinner, and after dinner with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn to Whitehall, where we and my Lord Brouncker attended the Council, to discourse about the fitness of entering of men presently for the manning of the fleet, before one ship is in condition to receive them. <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry did argue against it: I was wholly silent, because I saw the King, upon the earnestness of the Prince, was willing to it, crying very sillily, “If ever you intend to man the fleet, without being cheated by the captains and pursers, you may go to bed, and resolve never to have it manned;” and so it was, like other things, overruled that all volunteers should be presently entered. Then there was another great business about our signing of certificates to the Exchequer for [prize] goods, upon the £1,250,000 Act, which the Commissioners of the Treasury did all oppose, and to the laying fault upon us. But I did then speak to the justifying what we had done, even to the angering of Duncomb and Clifford, which I was vexed at: but, for all that, I did set the Office and myself right, and went away with the victory, my Lord Keeper saying that he would not advise the Council to order us to sign no more certificates. But, before I began to say anything in this matter, the King and the Duke of York talking at the Council-table, before all the Lords, of the Committee of Miscarriages, how this entering of men before the ships could be ready would be reckoned a miscarriage; “Why,” says the King, “it is then but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys making of another speech to them;” which made all the Lords, and there were by also the Attorney and Solicitor-General, look upon me. Thence Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and I, by hackney-coach to take a little ayre in Hyde Park, the first time I have been there this year; and we did meet many coaches going and coming, it being mighty pleasant weather; and so, coming back again, I ’light in the Pell Mell; and there went to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly, who continues very ill of his cold. And there come in Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Yelverton, whom Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly commended me to his acquaintance, which the other received, but without remembering to me, or I him, of our being schoolfellows together; and I said nothing of it. But he took notice of my speech the other day at the bar of the House; and indeed I perceive he is a wise man by his manner of discourse, and here he do say that the town is full of it, that now the Parliament hath resolved upon £300,000, the King, instead of fifty, will set out but twenty-five ships, and the Dutch as many; and that Smith is to command them, who is allowed to have the better of Holmes in the late dispute, and is in good esteem in the Parliament, above the other. Thence home, and there, in favour to my eyes, stayed at home, reading the ridiculous History of my Lord Newcastle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3951" id="noteref-3951" epub:type="noteref">3951</a> wrote by his wife, which shows her to be a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman, and he an asse to suffer her to write what she writes to him, and of him. Betty Turner sent my wife the book to read, and it being a fair print, to ease my eyes, which would be reading, I read that. Anon comes <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner and sat and talked with us, and most about the business of Ackworth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3952" id="noteref-3952" epub:type="noteref">3952</a> which comes before us tomorrow, that I would favour it, but I do not think, notwithstanding all the friendship I can show him, that he can escape, and therefore it had been better that he had followed the advice I sent him the other day by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, to make up the business. So parted, and I to bed, my eyes being very bad; and I know not how in the world to abstain from reading.</p>

Back to the Old Swan, and drank at Michell’s, whose house goes up apace, but I could not see Betty, and thence walked all along Thames Street, which I have not done since it was burned, as far as Billingsgate; and there do see a brave street likely to be, many brave houses being built, and of them a great many by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jaggard; but the raising of the street will make it mighty fine. So to the office, where busy all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and thence to the office, very busy till five o’clock, and then to ease my eyes I took my wife out and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> to the ’Change, and there bought them some things, and so home again and to the office, ended my letters, and so home to read a little more in last night’s book, with much sport, it being a foolish book, and so to supper and to bed. This afternoon I was surprised with a letter without a name to it, very well writ, in a good stile, giving me notice of my cousin Kate Joyce’s being likely to ruin herself by marriage, and by ill reports already abroad of her, and I do fear that this keeping of an inne may spoil her, being a young and pretty comely woman, and thought to be left well. I did answer the letter with thanks and good liking, and am resolved to take the advice he gives me, and go see her, and find out what I can: but if she will ruin herself, I cannot help it, though I should be troubled for it.</p>

At it all the morning, and so at noon home to dinner with my clerks, my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> being busy at work above in her chamber getting things ready and fine for her going into the country a week or two hence. I away by coach to Whitehall, where we met to wait on the Duke of York, and, soon as prayers were done, it being Good Friday, he come to us, and we did a little business and presented him with our demand of money, and so broke up, and I thence by coach to Kate Joyce’s, being desirous and in pain to speak with her about the business that I received a letter yesterday, but had no opportunity of speaking with her about it, company being with her, so I only invited her to come and dine with me on Sunday next, and so away home, and for saving my eyes at my chamber all the evening pricking down some things, and trying some conclusions upon my viol, in order to the inventing a better theory of music than hath yet been abroad; and I think verily I shall do it. So to supper with my wife, who is in very good humour with her working, and so am I, and so to bed. This day at Court I do hear that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn do command this summer’s fleet; and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Progers of the Bedchamber, as a secret, told me that the Prince Rupert is troubled at it, and several friends of his have been with him to know the reason of it; so that he do pity Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, whom he hath great kindness for, that he should not at any desire of his be put to this service, and thereby make the Prince his enemy, and contract more envy from other people. But I am not a whit sorry if it should be so, first for the King’s sake, that his work will be better done by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn than the Prince, and next that Penn, who is a false rogue, may be bit a little by it.</p>

Up betimes to the office, and there we sat all the morning, at noon home with my clerks, a good dinner, and then to the Office, and wrote my letters, and then abroad to do several things, and pay what little scores I had, and among others to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, and there did give 20<abbr>s.</abbr> to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cragg, her landlady, who was my Valentine in the house, as well as Doll Lane.⁠ ⁠… So home and to the office, there to end my letters, and so home, where Betty Turner was to see my wife, and she being gone I to my chamber to read a little again, and then after supper to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-01">22nd (Easter day)</time>. I up, and walked to the Temple, and there got a coach, and to Whitehall, where spoke with several people, and find by all that Penn is to go to sea this year with this fleet; and they excuse the Prince’s going, by saying it is not a command great enough for him. Here I met with Brisband, and, after hearing the service at the King’s chapel, where I heard the Bishop of Norwich, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Reynolds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3953" id="noteref-3953" epub:type="noteref">3953</a> the old presbyterian, begin a very plain sermon, he and I to the Queen’s chapel, and there did hear the Italians sing; and indeed their music did appear most admirable to me, beyond anything of ours: I was never so well satisfied in my life with it. So back to Whitehall, and there met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, and adjusted together how we should spend tomorrow together, and so by coach I home to dinner, where Kate Joyce was, as I invited her, and had a good dinner, only she and us; and after dinner she and I alone to talk about her business, as I designed; and I find her very discreet, and she assures me she neither do nor will incline to the doing anything towards marriage, without my advice, and did tell me that she had many offers, and that Harman and his friends would fain have her; but he is poor, and hath poor friends, and so it will not be advisable: but that there is another, a tobacconist, one Holinshed, whom she speaks well of, to be a plain, sober man, and in good condition, that offers her very well, and submits to me my examining and inquiring after it, if I see good, which I do like of it, for it will be best for her to marry, I think, as soon as she can⁠—at least, to be rid of this house; for the trade will not agree with a young widow, that is a little handsome, at least ordinary people think her so. Being well satisfied with her answer, she anon went away, and I to my closet to make a few more experiments of my notions in music, and so then my wife and I to walk in the garden, and then home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-02">23rd</time>. Up, and after discoursing with my wife about many things touching this day’s dinner, I abroad, and first to the tavern to pay what I owe there, but missed of seeing the mistress of the house, and there bespoke wine for dinner, and so away thence, and to Bishopsgate Street, thinking to have found a Harpsicon-maker that used to live there before the fire, but he is gone, and I have a mind forthwith to have a little Harpsicon made me to confirm and help me in my music notions, which my head is nowadays full of, and I do believe will come to something that is very good. Thence to Whitehall, expecting to have heard the Bishop of Lincolne, my friend, preach, for so I understood he would do yesterday, but was mistaken, and therefore away presently back again, and there find everything in good order against dinner, and at noon come <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce and she, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Manuel, the Jew’s wife, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Corbet, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s boy and girl. But we are defeated of Knepp, by her being forced to act today, and also of Harris, which did trouble me, they being my chief guests. However, I had an extraordinary good dinner, and the better because dressed by my own servants, and were mighty merry; and here was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pelling by chance come and dined with me; and after sitting long at dinner, I had a barge ready at Tower-wharf, to take us in, and so we went, all of us, up as high as Barne-Elms, a very fine day, and all the way sang; and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Manuel sings very finely, and is a mighty discreet, sober-carriaged woman, that both my wife and I are mightily taken with her, and sings well, and without importunity or the contrary. At Barne-Elms we walked round, and then to the barge again, and had much merry talk, and good singing; and come before it was dark to the New Exchange stairs, and there landed, and walked up to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s, where we sat awhile, and then up to their dining-room. And so, having a violin and theorbo, did fall to dance, here being also <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Floyd come hither, and by and by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harris. But there being so few of us that could dance, and my wife not being very well, we had not much pleasure in the dancing: there was Knepp also, by which with much pleasure we did sing a little, and so, about ten o’clock, I took coach with my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>, and so home, and there to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-03">24th</time>. Up pretty betimes, and so there comes to me <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shish, to desire my appearing for him to succeed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Christopher Pett,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3954" id="noteref-3954" epub:type="noteref">3954</a> lately dead, in his place of Master-Shipwright of Deptford and Woolwich, which I do resolve to promote what I can. So by and by to Whitehall, and there to the Duke of York’s chamber, where I understand it is already resolved by the King and Duke of York that Shish shall have the place. From the Duke’s chamber Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry and I to walk in the Matted Gallery; and there, among other things, he tells me of the wicked design that now is at last contriving against him, to get a petition presented from people that the money they have paid to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry for their places may be repaid them back; and that this is set on by Temple and Hollis of the Parliament, and, among other mean people in it, by Captain Tatnell: and he prays me that I will use some effectual way to sift Tatnell what he do, and who puts him on in this business, which I do undertake, and will do with all my skill for his service, being troubled that he is still under this difficulty. Thence up and down Westminster by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Burroughes her mother’s shop, thinking to have seen her, but could not, and therefore back to Whitehall, where great talk of the tumult at the other end of the town, about Moore-fields, among the ’prentices, taking the liberty of these holydays to pull down bawdyhouses.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3955" id="noteref-3955" epub:type="noteref">3955</a> And, Lord! to see the apprehensions which this did give to all people at Court, that presently order was given for all the soldiers, horse and foot, to be in armes! and forthwith alarmes were beat by drum and trumpet through Westminster, and all to their colours, and to horse, as if the French were coming into the town! So Creed, whom I met here, and I to Lincolne’s Inn-fields, thinking to have gone into the fields to have seen the ’prentices; but here we found these fields full of soldiers all in a body, and my Lord Craven commanding of them, and riding up and down to give orders, like a madman. And some young men we saw brought by soldiers to the Guard at Whitehall, and overheard others that stood by say, that it was only for pulling down the bawdyhouses; and none of the bystanders finding fault with them, but rather of the soldiers for hindering them. And we heard a justice of the Peace this morning say to the King, that he had been endeavouring to suppress this tumult, but could not; and that, imprisoning some [of them] in the new prison at Clerkenwell,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3956" id="noteref-3956" epub:type="noteref">3956</a> the rest did come and break open the prison and release them; and that they do give out that they are for pulling down the bawdyhouses, which is one of the greatest grievances of the nation. To which the King made a very poor, cold, insipid answer: “Why, why do they go to them, then?” and that was all, and had no mind to go on with the discourse. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed and I to dinner to my Lord Crew, where little discourse, there being none but us at the table, and my Lord and my Lady Jemimah, and so after dinner away, Creed and I to Whitehall, expecting a Committee of Tangier, but come too late. So I to attend the Council, and by and by were called in with Lord Brouncker and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn to advise how to pay away a little money to most advantage to the men of the yards, to make them dispatch the ships going out, and there did make a little speech, which was well liked, and after all it was found most satisfactory to the men, and best for the king’s dispatch, that what money we had should be paid weekly to the men for their week’s work until a greater sum could be got to pay them their arrears and then discharge them. But, Lord! to see what shifts and what cares and thoughts there was employed in this matter how to do the King’s work and please the men and stop clamours would make a man think the King should not eat a bit of good meat till he has got money to pay the men, but I do not see the least print of care or thoughts in him about it at all. Having done here, I out and there met Sir <abbr>Fr.</abbr> Hollis, who do still tell me that, above all things in the world, he wishes he had my tongue in his mouth, meaning since my speech in Parliament. He took Lord Brouncker and me down to the guards, he and his company being upon the guards today; and there he did, in a handsome room to that purpose, make us drink, and did call for his bagpipes, which, with pipes of ebony, tipt with silver, he did play beyond anything of that kind that ever I heard in my life; and with great pains he must have obtained it, but with pains that the instrument do not deserve at all; for, at the best, it is mighty barbarous music. So home and there to my chamber, to prick out my song, “It is Decreed,” intending to have it ready to give <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harris on Thursday, when we meet, for him to sing, believing that he will do it more right than a woman that sings better, unless it were Knepp, which I cannot have opportunity to teach it to. This evening I come home from Whitehall with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who fell in talk about his going to sea this year, and the difficulties that arise to him by it, by giving offence to the Prince, and occasioning envy to him, and many other things that make it a bad matter, at this time of want of money and necessaries, and bad and uneven counsels at home⁠—for him to go abroad: and did tell me how much with the King and Duke of York he had endeavoured to be excused, desiring the Prince might be satisfied in it, who hath a mind to go; but he tells me they will not excuse him, and I believe it, and truly do judge it a piece of bad fortune to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-04">25th</time>. Up, and walked to Whitehall, there to wait on the Duke of York, which I did: and in his chamber there, first by hearing the Duke of York call me by my name, my Lord Burlington did come to me, and with great respect take notice of me and my relation to my Lord Sandwich,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3957" id="noteref-3957" epub:type="noteref">3957</a> and express great kindness to me; and so to talk of my Lord Sandwich’s concernments. By and by the Duke of York is ready; and I did wait for an opportunity of speaking my mind to him about Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, his being unable to do the King any service, which I think do become me to do in all respects, and have Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s concurrence therein, which I therefore will seek a speedy opportunity to do, come what will come of it. The Duke of York and all with him this morning were full of the talk of the ’prentices, who are not yet [put] down, though the guards and militia of the town have been in armes all this night, and the night before; and the ’prentices have made fools of them, sometimes by running from them and flinging stones at them. Some blood hath been spilt, but a great many houses pulled down; and, among others, the Duke of York was mighty merry at that of Damaris Page’s, the great bawd of the seamen; and the Duke of York complained merrily that he hath lost two tenants, by their houses being pulled down, who paid him for their wine licenses £15 a year. But here it was said how these idle fellows have had the confidence to say that they did ill in contenting themselves in pulling down the little bawdyhouses, and did not go and pull down the great bawdyhouse at Whitehall. And some of them have the last night had a word among them, and it was “Reformation and Reducement.” This do make the courtiers ill at ease to see this spirit among people, though they think this matter will not come to much: but it speaks people’s minds; and then they do say that there are men of understanding among them, that have been of Cromwell’s army: but how true that is, I know not. Thence walked a little to Westminster, but met with nobody to spend any time with, and so by coach homeward, and in Seething Lane met young <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Daniel, and I stopped, and she had been at my house, but found nobody within, and tells me that she drew me for her Valentine this year, so I took her into the coach, and was going to the other end of the town, thinking to have taken her abroad, but remembering that I was to go out with my wife this afternoon,⁠ ⁠… and so to a milliner at the corner shop going into Bishopsgate and Leadenhall Street, and there did give her eight pair of gloves, and so dismissed her, and so I home and to dinner, and then with my wife to the King’s playhouse to see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Storme</i>, which we did, but without much pleasure, it being but a mean play compared with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Tempest</i>, at the Duke of York’s house, though Knepp did act her part of grief very well. Thence with my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> by coach to Islington, to the old house, and there eat and drank till it was almost night, and then home, being in fear of meeting the ’prentices, who are many of them yet, they say, abroad in the fields, but we got well home, and so I to my chamber a while, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-05">26th</time>. Up betimes to the office, where by and by my Lord Brouncker and I met and made an end of our business betimes. So I away with him to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams’s, and there dined, and thence I alone to the Duke of York’s house, to see the new play, called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Man Is the Master</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3958" id="noteref-3958" epub:type="noteref">3958</a> where the house was, it being not above one o’clock, very full. But my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> being there before, with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce and Corbet and Betty Turner, whom my wife carried with her, they made me room; and there I sat, it costing me 8<abbr>s.</abbr> upon them in oranges, at 6<abbr>d.</abbr> apiece. By and by the King come; and we sat just under him, so that I durst not turn my back all the play. The play is a translation out of French, and the plot Spanish, but not anything extraordinary at all in it, though translated by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Davenant, and so I found the King and his company did think meanly of it, though there was here and there something pretty: but the most of the mirth was sorry, poor stuff, of eating of sack posset and slabbering themselves, and mirth fit for clownes; the prologue but poor, and the epilogue little in it but the extraordinariness of it, it being sung by Harris and another<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3959" id="noteref-3959" epub:type="noteref">3959</a> in the form of a ballet. Thence, by agreement, we all of us to the Blue Balls, hard by, whither <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce also goes with us, who met us at the play, and anon comes Manuel, and his wife, and Knepp, and Harris, who brings with him <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Banister, the great master of music; and after much difficulty in getting of music, we to dancing, and then to a supper of some French dishes, which yet did not please me, and then to dance and sing; and mighty merry we were till about eleven or twelve at night, with mighty great content in all my company, and I did, as I love to do, enjoy myself in my pleasure as being the height of what we take pains for and can hope for in this world, and therefore to be enjoyed while we are young and capable of these joys. My wife extraordinary fine today, in her flower tabby suit, bought a year and more ago, before my mother’s death put her into mourning, and so not worn till this day: and everybody in love with it; and indeed she is very fine and handsome in it. I having paid the reckoning, which come to almost £4, we parted: my company and William Batelier, who was also with us, home in a coach, round by the Wall, where we met so many stops by the Watches, that it cost us much time and some trouble, and more money, to every Watch, to them to drink; this being encreased by the trouble the ’prentices did lately give the City, so that the Militia and Watches are very strict at this time; and we had like to have met with a stop for all night at the Constable’s watch, at Mooregate, by a pragmatical Constable; but we come well home at about two in the morning, and so to bed. This noon, from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams’s, my Lord Brouncker sent to Somersett House to hear how the Duchess of Richmond do; and word was brought him that she is pretty well, but mighty full of the smallpox, by which all do conclude she will be wholly spoiled, which is the greatest instance of the uncertainty of beauty that could be in this age; but then she hath had the benefit of it to be first married, and to have kept it so long, under the greatest temptations in the world from a King, and yet without the least imputation. This afternoon, at the play, Sir <abbr>Fr.</abbr> Hollis spoke to me as a secret, and matter of confidence in me, and friendship to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who is now out of town, that it were well he were made acquainted that he finds in the House of Commons, which met this day, several motions made for the calling strictly again upon the Miscarriages, and particularly in the business of the Prises, and the not prosecuting of the first victory, only to give an affront to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, whose going to sea this year do give them matter of great dislike. So though I do not much trouble myself for him, yet I am sorry that he should have this fall so unhappily without any fault, but rather merit of his own that made him fitter for this command than anybody else, and the more for that this business of his may haply occasion their more eager pursuit against the whole body of the office.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-06">27th</time>. Up, and walked to the waterside, and thence to Whitehall to the Duke of York’s chamber, where he being ready he went to a Committee of Tangier, where I first understand that my Lord Sandwich is, in his coming back from Spain, to step over thither, to see in what condition the place is, which I am glad of, hoping that he will be able to do some good there, for the good of the place, which is so much out of order. Thence to walk a little in Westminster Hall, where the Parliament I find sitting, but spoke with nobody to let me know what they are doing, nor did I enquire. Thence to the Swan and drank, and did <i xml:lang="fr">baiser</i> Frank, and so down by water back again, and to the Exchange a turn or two, only to show myself, and then home to dinner, where my wife and I had a small squabble, but I first this day tried the effect of my silence and not provoking her when she is in an ill humour, and do find it very good, for it prevents its coming to that height on both sides which used to exceed what was fit between us. So she become calm by and by and fond, and so took coach, and she to the mercer’s to buy some lace, while I to Whitehall, but did nothing, but then to Westminster Hall and took a turn, and so to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, and there did sit a little and talk and drink, and did <i xml:lang="fr">hazer con</i> her, and so took coach and called my wife at Unthanke’s, and so up and down to the Nursery, where they did not act, then to the New Cockpit, and there missed, and then to Hide Park, where many coaches, but the dust so great, that it was troublesome, and so by night home, where to my chamber and finished my pricking out of my song for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harris (“It is decreed”), and so a little supper, being very sleepy and weary since last night, and so by 10 o’clock to bed and slept well all night. This day, at noon, comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pelling to me, and shows me the stone cut lately out of Sir Thomas Adams<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3960" id="noteref-3960" epub:type="noteref">3960</a> (the old comely Alderman’s) body, which is very large indeed, bigger I think than my fist, and weighs above twenty-five ounces and, which is very miraculous, he never in all his life had any fit of it, but lived to a great age without pain, and died at last of something else, without any sense of this in all his life. This day Creed at Whitehall in discourse told me what information he hath had, from very good hands, of the cowardice and ill-government of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jer.</abbr> Smith and Sir Thomas Allen, and the repute they have both of them abroad in the Streights, from their deportment when they did at several times command there; and that, above all Englishmen that ever were there, there never was any man that behaved himself like poor Charles Wager, whom the very Moores do mention, with teares sometimes.</p>

Our greatest business at the office today is our want of money for the setting forth of these ships that are to go out, and my people at dinner tell me that they do verily doubt that the want of men will be so great, as we must press; and if we press, there will be mutinies in the town; for the seamen are said already to have threatened the pulling down of the Treasury Office; and if they do once come to that, it will not be long before they come to ours.</p>

Up, and I to Church, where I have not been these many weeks before, and there did first find a strange Reader, who could not find in the Service-book the place for churching women, but was fain to change books with the clerke: and then a stranger preached, a seeming able man; but said in his pulpit that God did a greater work in raising of an oake-tree from an acorn, than a man’s body raising it, at the last day, from his dust (showing the possibility of the Resurrection): which was, methought, a strange saying. At home to dinner, whither comes and dines with me <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe, and by invitation <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Harris and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Banister, most extraordinary company both, the latter for music of all sorts, the former for everything: here we sang, and Banister played on the theorbo, and afterwards Banister played on his flageolet, and I had very good discourse with him about music, so confirming some of my new notions about music that it puts me upon a resolution to go on and make a scheme and theory of music not yet ever made in the world. Harris do so commend my wife’s picture of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hales’s, that I shall have him draw Harris’s head; and he hath also persuaded me to have Cooper draw my wife’s, which, though it cost £30, yet I will have done. Thus spent the afternoon most deliciously, and then broke up and walked with them as far as the Temple, and there parted, and I took coach to Westminster, but there did nothing, meeting nobody that I had a mind to speak with, and so home, and there find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pelling, and then also comes <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and supped and talked with us, and so to bed. I do hear by several that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s going to sea do dislike the Parliament mightily, and that they have revived the Committee of Miscarriages to find something to prevent it; and that he being the other day with the Duke of Albemarle to ask his opinion touching his going to sea, the Duchess overheard and come in to him, and asks <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn how he durst have the confidence to offer to go to sea again, to the endangering the nation, when he knew himself such a coward as he was, which, if true, is very severe.</p>

Here I did see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stewart’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3962" id="noteref-3962" epub:type="noteref">3962</a> picture as when a young maid, and now just done before her having the smallpox: and it would make a man weep to see what she was then, and what she is like to be, by people’s discourse, now. Here I saw my Lord General’s picture, and my Lord Arlington and Ashly’s, and several others; but among the rest one Swinfen, that was Secretary to my Lord Manchester, Lord Chamberlain, with Cooling, done so admirably as I never saw anything: but the misery was, this fellow died in debt, and never paid Cooper for his picture; but, it being seized on by his creditors, among his other goods, after his death, Cooper himself says that he did buy it, and give £25 out of his purse for it, for what he was to have had but £30. Being infinitely satisfied with this sight, and resolving that my wife shall be drawn by him when she comes out of the country, I away with Harris and Hales to the Coffeehouse, sending my people away, and there resolve for Hales to begin Harris’s head for me, which I will be at the cost of. After a little talk, I away to Whitehall and Westminster, where I find the Parliament still bogling about the raising of this money: and everybody’s mouth full now; and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wren himself tells me that the Duke of York declares to go to sea himself this year; and I perceive it is only on this occasion of distaste of the Parliament against <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s going, and to prevent the Prince’s: but I think it is mighty hot counsel for the Duke of York at this time to go out of the way; but, Lord! what a pass are all our matters come to! At noon by appointment to Cursitor’s Alley, in Chancery Lane, to meet Captain Cocke and some other creditors of the Navy, and their Counsel, Pemberton, North,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3963" id="noteref-3963" epub:type="noteref">3963</a> Offly, and Charles Porter; and there dined, and talked of the business of the assignments on the Exchequer of the £1,250,000 on behalf of our creditors; and there I do perceive that the Counsel had heard of my performance in the Parliamenthouse lately, and did value me and what I said accordingly. At dinner we had a great deal of good discourse about Parliament: their number being uncertain, and always at the will of the King to encrease, as he saw reason to erect a new borough. But all concluded that the bane of the Parliament hath been the leaving off the old custom of the places allowing wages to those that served them in Parliament, by which they chose men that understood their business and would attend it, and they could expect an account from, which now they cannot; and so the Parliament is become a company of men unable to give account for the interest of the place they serve for. Thence, the meeting of the Counsel with the King’s Counsel this afternoon being put off by reason of the death of Serjeant Maynard’s lady,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3964" id="noteref-3964" epub:type="noteref">3964</a> I to Whitehall, where the Parliament was to wait on the King; and they did: and it was to be told that he did think fit to tell them that they might expect to be adjourned at Whitsuntide, and that they might make haste to raise their money; but this, I fear, will displease them, who did expect to sit as long as they pleased, and whether this be done by the King upon some new counsel I know not, for the King must be beholding to them till they do settle this business of money. Great talk today as if Beaufort<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3965" id="noteref-3965" epub:type="noteref">3965</a> was come into the Channel with about 20 ships, and it makes people apprehensive, but yet the Parliament do not stir a bit faster in the business of money. Here I met with Creed, expecting a Committee of Tangier, but the Committee met not, so he and I up and down, having nothing to do, and particularly to the New Cockpit by the King’s Gate in Holborne, but seeing a great deal of rabble we did refuse to go in, but took coach and to Hide Park, and there till all the tour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3966" id="noteref-3966" epub:type="noteref">3966</a> was empty, and so he and I to the Lodge in the Park, and there eat and drank till it was night, and then carried him to Whitehall, having had abundance of excellent talk with him in reproach of the times and managements we live under, and so I home, and there to talk and to supper with my wife, and so to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-04-10">31st</time>. Up pretty betimes and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon I home to dinner, where uncle Thomas dined with me, as he do every quarter, and I paid him his pension; and also comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollier a little fuddled, and so did talk nothing but Latin, and laugh, that it was very good sport to see a sober man in such a humour, though he was not drunk to scandal. At dinner comes a summons for this office and the Victualler to attend a Committee of Parliament this afternoon, with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden, which I accordingly did, with my papers relating to the sending of victuals to Sir John Harman’s fleet; and there, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Brookes in the chair, we did give them a full account, but, Lord! to see how full they are and immoveable in their jealousy that some means are used to keep Harman from coming home, for they have an implacable desire to know the bottom of the not improving the first victory, and would lay it upon Brouncker. Having given them good satisfaction I away thence, up and down, wanting a little to see whether I could get <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Burroughes out, but <i xml:lang="fr">elle</i> being in the shop <i xml:lang="la">ego</i> did speak <i xml:lang="es">con</i> her much, she could not then go far, and so I took coach and away to Unthanke’s, and there took up my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>, and to the Park, where, being in a hackney, and they undressed, was ashamed to go into the tour, but went round the park, and so with pleasure home, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pelling come and sat and talked late with us, and he being gone, I called <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> to take pen, ink, and paper and write down what things come into my head for my wife to do in order to her going into the country, and the girl, writing not so well as she would do, cried, and her mistress construed it to be sullenness, and so away angry with her too, but going to bed she undressed me, and there I did give her good advice and <i xml:lang="fr">baiser la, elle</i> weeping still.</p>
