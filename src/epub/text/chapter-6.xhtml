			<article id="entry-1660-6-11" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-06-11">June 1st</time>. This morning <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply disposed of the money that the Duke of York did give my Lord’s servants, 22 ducatoons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-509" id="noteref-509" epub:type="noteref">509</a> came to my share, whereof he told me to give Jaspar something because my Lord left him out. I did give <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheply the fine pair of buckskin gloves that I bought myself about five years ago. My Lord took physic today, and so come not out all day. The Captain on shore all day. After dinner Captain Jefferys and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe, and the Lieutenant and I to ninepins, where I lost about two shillings and so fooled away all the afternoon. At night <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke comes from London with letters, leaving all things there very gallant and joyful. And brought us word that the Parliament had ordered the 29th of May, the King’s birthday,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-510" id="noteref-510" epub:type="noteref">510</a> to be forever kept as a day of thanksgiving for our redemption from tyranny, and the King’s return to his Government, he entering London that day. My wife was in London when he came thither, and had been there a week with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bowyer and his wife. My poor wife has not been well a week before, but thanks be to God is well again. She would fain see me and be at her house again, but we must be content. She writes word how the Joyces grow very rich and very proud, but it is no matter, and that there was a talk that I should be knighted by the King, which they (the Joyces) laugh at; but I think myself happier in my wife and estate than they are in theirs. To bed. The Captain come on board, when I was going to bed, quite fuddled; and himself the next morning told me so too, that the Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and he had been drinking all day.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-06-12">2nd</time>. Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabin, I took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that he had given me of his Majesty’s money, and the Duke’s. He told the he hoped to do me a more lasting kindness, if all things stand as they are now between him and the King, but, says he, “We must have a little patience and we will rise together; in the meantime I will do you all the good jobs I can.” Which was great content for me to hear from my Lord. All the morning with the Captain, computing how much the thirty ships that come with the King from Scheveling their pay comes to for a month (because the King promised to give them all a month’s pay), and it comes to £6,538, and the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i> particularly £777. I wish we had the money. All the afternoon with two or three captains in the Captain’s cabin, drinking of white wine and sugar, and eating pickled oysters, where Captain Sparling told us the best story that ever I heard, about a gentleman that persuaded a country fool to let him gut his oysters or else they would stink. At night writing letters to London and Weymouth, for my Lord being now to sit in the House of Peers he endeavours to get <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Montagu for Weymouth and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George for Dover.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-511" id="noteref-511" epub:type="noteref">511</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke late with me in my cabin while I wrote to my wife, and drank a bottle of wine and so took leave of me on his journey and I to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-06-13">3rd</time>. Waked in the morning by one who when I asked who it was, he told me one from Bridewell, which proved Captain Holland. I rose presently to him. He is come to get an order for the setting out of his ship, and to renew his commission. He tells me how every man goes to the Lord Mayor to set down their names, as such as do accept of his Majesty’s pardon, and showed me a certificate under the Lord Mayor’s hand that he had done so. At sermon in the morning; after dinner into my cabin, to cast my accounts up, and find myself to be worth near £100, for which I bless Almighty God, it being more than I hoped for so soon, being I believe not clearly worth £25 when I came to sea besides my house and goods. Then to set my papers in order, they being increased much upon my hands through want of time to put them in order. The ship’s company all this while at sermon. After sermon my Lord did give me instruction to write to London about business, which done, after supper to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-6-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-06-14">4th</time>. Waked in the morning at four o’clock to give some money to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hetly, who was to go to London with the letters that I wrote yesterday night. After he was gone I went and lay down in my gown upon my bed again an hour or two. At last waked by a messenger come for a Post Warrant for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hetly and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, who stood to give so little for their horses that the men would not let them have any without a warrant, which I sent them. All the morning getting Captain Holland’s commission done, which I did, and he at noon went away. I took my leave of him upon the quarterdeck with a bottle of sack, my Lord being just set down to dinner. Then he being gone I went to dinner and after dinner to my cabin to write. This afternoon I showed my Lord my accounts, which he passed, and so I think myself to be worth near £100 now. In the evening I made an order for Captain Sparling of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Assistance</i> to go to Middleburgh, to fetch over some of the King’s goods. I took the opportunity to send all my Dutch money, 70 ducatoons and 29 gold ducats to be changed, if he can, for English money, which is the first venture that ever I made, and so I have been since a little afeard of it. After supper some music and so to bed. This morning the King’s Proclamation against drinking, swearing, and debauchery, was read to our ships’ companies in the fleet, and indeed it gives great satisfaction to all.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-512" id="noteref-512" epub:type="noteref">512</a></p>

			<article id="entry-1660-6-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-06-15">5th</time>. Abed late. In the morning my Lord went on shore with the Vice-Admiral a-fishing, and at dinner returned. In the afternoon I played at ninepins with my Lord, and when he went in again I got him to sign my accounts for £115, and so upon my private balance I find myself confirmed in my estimation that I am worth £100. In the evening in my cabin a great while getting the song without book, “<span epub:type="se:name.music.song">Help, Help Divinity, <abbr>etc.</abbr></span>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-513" id="noteref-513" epub:type="noteref">513</a> After supper my Lord called for the lieutenant’s cittern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-514" id="noteref-514" epub:type="noteref">514</a> and with two candlesticks with money in them for symballs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-515" id="noteref-515" epub:type="noteref">515</a> we made barber’s music,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-516" id="noteref-516" epub:type="noteref">516</a> with which my Lord was well pleased. So to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1660-6-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1660-06-16">6th</time>. In the morning I had letters come, that told me among other things, that my Lord’s place of Clerk of the Signet was fallen to him, which he did most lovingly tell me that I should execute, in case he could not get a better employment for me at the end of the year. Because he thought that the Duke of York would command all, but he hoped that the Duke would not remove me but to my advantage.</p>
				<p>I had a great deal of talk about my uncle Robert,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-517" id="noteref-517" epub:type="noteref">517</a> and he told me that he could not tell how his mind stood as to his estate, but he would do all that lay in his power for me. After dinner came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gooke from London, who told me that my wife he left well at Huntsmore, though her health not altogether so constant as it used to be, which my heart is troubled for. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore’s letters tell me that he thinks my Lord will be suddenly sent for up to London, and so I got myself in readiness to go.</p>
				<p>My letters tell me, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Calamy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-518" id="noteref-518" epub:type="noteref">518</a> had preached before the King in a surplice (this I heard afterwards to be false); that my Lord, <abbr>Gen.</abbr> Monk, and three more Lords, are made Commissioners for the Treasury;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-519" id="noteref-519" epub:type="noteref">519</a> that my Lord had some great place conferred on him, and they say Master of the Wardrobe;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-520" id="noteref-520" epub:type="noteref">520</a> that the two Dukes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-521" id="noteref-521" epub:type="noteref">521</a> do haunt the Park much, and that they were at a play, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Madam Epicene</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-522" id="noteref-522" epub:type="noteref">522</a> the other day; that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Ant.</abbr> Cooper, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollis, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Annesly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-523" id="noteref-523" epub:type="noteref">523</a> late President of the Council of State, are made Privy Councillors to the King. At night very busy sending <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Donne away to London, and wrote to my father for a coat to be made me against I come to London, which I think will not be long. At night <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Montagu came on board and stayed long up with my Lord. I to bed and about one in the morning,</p>

About three in the morning the people began to wash the deck, and the water came pouring into my mouth, which waked me, and I was fain to rise and get on my gown, and sleep leaning on my table. This morning <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu went away again. After dinner come <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Wright and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, with the sight of whom my heart was very glad. They brought an order for my Lord’s coming up to London, which my Lord resolved to do tomorrow. All the afternoon getting my things in order to set forth tomorrow. At night walked up and down with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, who did give me an account of all things at London.

Thence to the Admiralty, and despatched away <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke to sea; whose business was a letter from my Lord about <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Montagu to be chosen as a Parliament-man in my Lord’s room at Dover;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-540" id="noteref-540" epub:type="noteref">540</a> and another to the Vice-Admiral to give my Lord a constant account of all things in the fleet, merely that he may thereby keep up his power there; another letter to <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Cuttance to send the barge that brought the King on shore, to Hinchingbroke by Lynne.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-541" id="noteref-541" epub:type="noteref">541</a> To my own house, meeting <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Vines, and drank with him at Charing Cross, now the King’s Head Tavern.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-542" id="noteref-542" epub:type="noteref">542</a> With my wife to my father’s, where met with Swan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-543" id="noteref-543" epub:type="noteref">543</a> an old hypocrite, and with him, his friend and my father, and my cousin Scott to the Bear Tavern.

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-01">21st</time>. To my Lord, much business. With him to the Council Chamber, where he was sworn; and the charge of his being admitted Privy Counsellor is £26. To the Dog Tavern at Westminster, where Murford with Captain Curle and two friends of theirs went to drink. Captain Curle, late of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Maria</i>, gave me five pieces in gold and a silver can for my wife for the Commission I did give him this day for his ship, dated April 20, 1660 last. Thence to the Parliament door and came to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s to dinner with my Lord, and with my Lord to see the great Wardrobe, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend brought us to the governor of some poor children in tawny clothes; who had been maintained there these eleven years, which put my Lord to a stand how to dispose of them, that he may have the house for his use. The children did sing finely, and my Lord did bid me give them five pieces in gold at his going away. Thence back to Whitehall, where, the King being gone abroad, my Lord and I walked a great while discoursing of the simplicity of the Protector, in his losing all that his father had left him. My Lord told me, that the last words that he parted with the Protector with (when he went to the Sound), were, that he should rejoice more to see him in his grave at his return home, than that he should give way to such things as were then in hatching, and afterwards did ruin him: and the Protector said, that whatever <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Montagu, my Lord Broghill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-544" id="noteref-544" epub:type="noteref">544</a> Jones,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-545" id="noteref-545" epub:type="noteref">545</a> and the Secretary, would have him to do, he would do it, be it what it would. Thence to my wife, meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave, who went home with me, and did give me a lesson upon the flageolet, and handselled my silver can with my wife and me. To my father’s, where Sir Thomas Honeywood and his family were come of a sudden, and so we forced to lie all together in a little chamber, three stories high.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1660-07-02">22nd</time>. To my Lord, where much business. With him to Whitehall, where the Duke of York not being up, we walked a good while in the Shield Gallery. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill (who for these two or three days hath constantly attended my Lord) told me of an offer of £500 for a Baronet’s dignity, which I told my Lord of in the balcone in this gallery, and he said he would think of it. I to my Lord’s and gave order for horses to be got to draw my Lord’s great coach to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Morrice the upholsterer came himself today to take notice what furniture we lack for our lodgings at Whitehall. My dear friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fuller of Twickenham<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-546" id="noteref-546" epub:type="noteref">546</a> and I dined alone at the Sun Tavern, where he told me how he had the grant of being Dean of <abbr>St.</abbr> Patrick’s, in Ireland; and I told him my condition, and both rejoiced one for another. Thence to my Lord’s, and had the great coach to Brigham’s, who went with me to the Half Moon, and gave me a can of good julep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-547" id="noteref-547" epub:type="noteref">547</a> and told me how my Lady Monk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-548" id="noteref-548" epub:type="noteref">548</a> deals with him and others for their places, asking him £500, though he was formerly the King’s coach-maker, and sworn to it. My Lord abroad, and I to my house and set things in a little order there. So with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore to my father’s, I staying with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner who stood at her door as I passed. Among other things she told me for certain how my old Lady Middlesex ⸻ herself the other day in the presence of the King, and people took notice of it. Thence called at my father’s, and so to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hetley had sent a letter for me, and two pair of silk stockings, one for <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe, and the other for me. To Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Wright’s to my Lord, where he was, and took direction about business, and so by link home about 11 o’clock.

Among others some simple ones from our Lieutenant, <abbr>Lieut.</abbr> Lambert to him and myself, which made <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew and us all laugh. I went to my father’s to tell him that I would not come to supper, and so after my business done at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s I went home and my wife within a little while after me, my mind all this while full of thoughts for my place of Clerk of the Acts.</p>

He was very civil to me, and I to him, and shall be so. There came a letter from my Lady Monk to my Lord about it this evening, but he refused to come to her, but meeting in Whitehall, with Sir Thomas Clarges, her brother, my Lord returned answer, that he could not desist in my business; and that he believed that General Monk would take it ill if my Lord should name the officers in his army; and therefore he desired to have the naming of one officer in the fleet. With my Lord by coach to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s, and very merry by the way, discoursing of the late changes and his good fortune. Thence home, and then with my wife to Dorset House, to deliver a list of the names of the justices of the peace for Huntingdonshire.

A very civil gentleman. At Dorset House I met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kipps, my old friend, with whom the world is well changed, he being now sealbearer to the Lord Chancellor, at which my wife and I are well pleased, he being a very good natured man.

This night my Lord and I looked over the list of the Captains, and marked some that my Lord had a mind to have put out. Home and to bed. Our wench very lame, abed these two days.</p>
