			<article id="entry-1664-8-11" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-11">August 1st</time>. Up, my mind very light from my last night’s accounts, and so up and with Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten, and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, where among other things having prepared with some industry every man a part this morning and no sooner (for fear they should either consider of it or discourse of it one to another) <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry did move the Duke and obtain it that one of the clerkes of the Clerke of the Acts should have an addition of £30 a year, as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Turner hath, which I am glad of, that I may give <abbr class="name">T.</abbr> Hater £20 and keep £10 towards a boy’s keeping. Thence <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and I to the Attorney’s chamber at the Temple, but not being there we parted, and I home, and there with great joy told <abbr class="name">T.</abbr> Hater what I had done, with which the poor wretch was very glad, though his modesty would not suffer him to say much. So to the Coffeehouse, and there all the house full of the victory Generall Soushe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2229" id="noteref-2229" epub:type="noteref">2229</a> (who is a Frenchman, a soldier of fortune, commanding part of the German army) hath had against the Turke; killing 4,000 men, and taking most extraordinary spoil. Thence taking up Harman and his wife, carried them to Anthony Joyce’s, where we had my venison in a pasty well done; but, Lord! to see how much they made of it, as if they had never eat any before, and very merry we were, but Will most troublesomely so, and I find he and his wife have a most wretched life one with another, but we took no notice, but were very merry as I could be in such company. But <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Harman is a very pretty-humoured wretch, whom I could love with all my heart, being so good and innocent company. Thence to Westminster to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave’s, and there, after singing a thing or two over, I spoke to him about a woman for my wife, and he offered me his kinswoman, which I was glad of, but she is not at present well, but however I hope to have her. Thence to my Lord Chancellor’s, and thence with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, who appointed to meet me there, and with him to the Attorney General, and there with Sir <abbr class="name">Ph.</abbr> Warwicke consulted of a new commission to be had through the Broad Seale to enable us to make this contract for Tangier victualling. So home, and there talked long with Will about the young woman of his family which he spoke of for to live with my wife, but though she hath very many good qualitys, yet being a neighbour’s child and young and not very staid, I dare not venture of having her, because of her being able to spread any report of our family upon any discontent among the heart of our neighbours. So that my dependance is upon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave, and so home to supper and to bed. Last night, at 12 o’clock, I was waked with knocking at Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn’s door; and what was it but people’s running up and down to bring him word that his brother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2230" id="noteref-2230" epub:type="noteref">2230</a> who hath been a good while, it seems, sicke, is dead.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-12" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-12">2nd</time>. At the office all the morning. At noon dined, and then to the ’Change, and there walked two hours or more with Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Warren, who after much discourse in general of Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten’s dealings, he fell to talk how everybody must live by their places, and that he was willing, if I desired it, that I should go shares with him in anything that he deals in. He told me again and again, too, that he confesses himself my debtor too for my service and friendship to him in his present great contract of masts, and that between this and Christmas he shall be in stocke and will pay it me. This I like well, but do not desire to become a merchant, and, therefore, put it off, but desired time to think of it. Thence to the King’s playhouse, and there saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Bartholomew Fayre</i>, which do still please me; and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the world, I believe. I chanced to sit by Tom Killigrew, who tells me that he is setting up a Nursery;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2231" id="noteref-2231" epub:type="noteref">2231</a> that is, is going to build a house in Moorefields, wherein he will have common plays acted. But four operas it shall have in the year, to act six weeks at a time; where we shall have the best scenes and machines, the best musique, and everything as magnificent as is in Christendome; and to that end hath sent for voices and painters and other persons from Italy. Thence homeward called upon my Lord Marlborough, and so home and to my office, and then to Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn, and with him and our fellow officers and servants of the house and none else to Church to lay his brother in the ground, wherein nothing handsome at all, but that he lays him under the Communion table in the chancel, about nine at night.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2232" id="noteref-2232" epub:type="noteref">2232</a> So home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-13">3rd</time>. Up betimes and set some joyners on work to new lay my floor in our wardrobe, which I intend to make a room for musique. Thence abroad to Westminster, among other things to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave’s, and there had his consent for his kinswoman to come to be with my wife for her woman, at which I am well pleased and hope she may do well. Thence to Whitehall to meet with Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret about hiring some ground to make our mast docke at Deptford, but being Council morning failed, but met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and he and I discoursed of the likeliness of a Dutch warr, which I think is very likely now, for the Dutch do prepare a fleet to oppose us at Guinny, and he do think we shall, though neither of us have a mind to it, fall into it of a sudden, and yet the plague do increase among them, and is got into their fleet, and Opdam’s own ship, which makes it strange they should be so high. Thence to the ’Change, and thence home to dinner, and down by water to Woolwich to the rope yard, and there visited <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Falconer, who tells me odd stories of how Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn was rewarded by her husband with a gold watch (but seems not certain of what Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten told me, of his daughter having a life given her in £80 per <abbr>ann.</abbr>) for his helping him to his place, and yet cost him £150 to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry besides. He did much advise it seems <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer not to marry again, expressing that he would have him make his daughter his heire, or words to that purpose, and that that makes him, she thinks, so cold in giving her any satisfaction, and that <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Boddam hath publicly said, since he came down thither to be clerke of the ropeyard, that it hath this week cost him £100, and would be glad that it would cost him but half as much more for the place, and that he was better before than now, and that if he had been to have bought it, he would not have given so much for it. Now I am sure that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry hath again and again said that he would take nothing, but would give all his part in it freely to him, that so the widow might have something. What the meaning of this is I know not, but that Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn do get something by it. Thence to the Dockeyard, and there saw the new ship in great forwardness. So home and to supper, and then to the office, where late, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bland and I talking about Tangier business, and so home to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-14">4th</time>. Up betimes and to the office, fitting myself against a great dispute about the East India Company, which spent afterwards with us all the morning. At noon dined with Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn, a piece of beef only, and I counterfeited a friendship and mirth which I cannot have with him, yet out with him by his coach, and he did carry me to a play and pay for me at the King’s house, which is <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Rivall Ladys</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2233" id="noteref-2233" epub:type="noteref">2233</a> a very innocent and most pretty witty play. I was much pleased with it, and it being given me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2234" id="noteref-2234" epub:type="noteref">2234</a> I look upon it as no breach to my oathe. Here we hear that Clun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2235" id="noteref-2235" epub:type="noteref">2235</a> one of their best actors, was, the last night, going out of towne (after he had acted <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Alchymist</i>, wherein was one of his best parts that he acts) to his country-house, set upon and murdered; one of the rogues taken, an Irish fellow. It seems most cruelly butchered and bound. The house will have a great miss of him. Thence visited my Lady Sandwich, who tells me my Lord FitzHarding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2236" id="noteref-2236" epub:type="noteref">2236</a> is to be made a Marquis. Thence home to my office late, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-15">5th</time>. Up very betimes and set my plaisterer to work about whiting and colouring my musique roome, which having with great pleasure seen done, about ten o’clock I dressed myself, and so mounted upon a very pretty mare, sent me by Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Warren, according to his promise yesterday. And so through the City, not a little proud, God knows, to be seen upon so pretty a beast, and to my cousin <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Joyce’s, who presently mounted too, and he and I out of towne toward Highgate; in the way, at Kentish-towne, showing me the place and manner of Clun’s being killed and laid in a ditch, and yet was not killed by any wounds, having only one in his arm, but bled to death through his struggling. He told me, also, the manner of it, of his going home so late [from] drinking with his whore, and manner of having it found out. Thence forward to Barnett, and there drank, and so by night to Stevenage, it raining a little, but not much, and there to my great trouble, find that my wife was not come, nor any Stamford coach gone down this week, so that she cannot come. So vexed and weary, and not thoroughly out of pain neither in my old parts, I after supper to bed, and after a little sleep, <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Joyce comes in his shirt into my chamber, with a note and a messenger from my wife, that she was come by Yorke coach to Bigglesworth, and would be with us tomorrow morning. So, mightily pleased at her discreete action in this business, I with peace to sleep again till next morning. So up, and</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-16">6th</time>. Here lay Deane Honiwood last night. I met and talked with him this morning, and a simple priest he is, though a good, well-meaning man. <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Joyce and I to a game at bowles on the green there till eight o’clock, and then comes my wife in the coach, and a coach full of women, only one man riding by, gone down last night to meet a sister of his coming to town. So very joyful drank there, not ’lighting, and we mounted and away with them to Welling,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2237" id="noteref-2237" epub:type="noteref">2237</a> and there ’light, and dined very well and merry and glad to see my poor-wife. Here very merry as being weary I could be, and after dinner, out again, and to London. In our way all the way the mightiest merry, at a couple of young gentlemen, come down to meet the same gentlewoman, that ever I was in my life, and so <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Joyce too, to see how one of them was horsed upon a hard-trotting sorrell horse, and both of them soundly weary and galled. But it is not to be set down how merry we were all the way. We ’light in Holborne, and by another coach my wife and maid home, and I by horseback, and found all things well and most mighty neate and clean. So, after welcoming my wife a little, to the office, and so home to supper, and then weary and not very well to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-17">7th (Lord’s day)</time>. Lay long caressing my wife and talking, she telling me sad stories of the ill, improvident, disquiet, and sluttish manner that my father and mother and Pall live in the country, which troubles me mightily, and I must seek to remedy it. So up and ready, and my wife also, and then down and I showed my wife, to her great admiration and joy, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden’s present of plate, the two flaggons, which indeed are so noble that I hardly can think that they are yet mine. So blessing God for it, we down to dinner mighty pleasant, and so up after dinner for a while, and I then to Whitehall, walked thither, having at home met with a letter of Captain Cooke’s, with which he had sent a boy for me to see, whom he did intend to recommend to me. I therefore went and there met and spoke with him. He gives me great hopes of the boy, which pleases me, and at Chapel I there met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave, who gives a report of the boy, and he showed me him, and I spoke to him, and the boy seems a good willing boy to come to me, and I hope will do well. I am to speak to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend to hasten his clothes for him, and then he is to come. So I walked homeward and met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spong, and he with me as far as the Old Exchange talking of many ingenuous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2238" id="noteref-2238" epub:type="noteref">2238</a> things, musique, and at last of glasses, and I find him still the same ingenuous man that ever he was, and do among other fine things tell me that by his microscope of his owne making he do discover that the wings of a moth is made just as the feathers of the wing of a bird, and that most plainly and certainly. While we were talking came by several poor creatures carried by, by constables, for being at a conventicle. They go like lambs, without any resistance. I would to God they would either conform, or be more wise, and not be catched! Thence parted with him, mightily pleased with his company, and away homeward, calling at Dan Rawlinson, and supped there with my uncle Wight, and then home and eat again for form sake with her, and then to prayers and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-18">8th</time>. Up and abroad with Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten, by coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, where by the way he did tell me how Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes would many times arrogate to himself the doing of that that all the Board have equal share in, and more that to himself which he hath had nothing to do in, and particularly the late paper given in by him to the Duke, the translation of a Dutch print concerning the quarrel between us and them, which he did give as his own when it was Sir Richard Ford’s wholly. Also he told me how Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn (it falling in our discourse touching <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Falconer) was at first very great for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry to bring him in guests, and that at high rates for places, and very open was he to me therein. After business done with the Duke, I home to the Coffeehouse, and so home to dinner, and after dinner to hang up my fine pictures in my dining room, which makes it very pretty, and so my wife and I abroad to the King’s playhouse, she giving me her time of the last month, she having not seen any then; so my vowe is not broke at all, it costing me no more money than it would have done upon her, had she gone both her times that were due to her. Here we saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Flora’s Figarys</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2239" id="noteref-2239" epub:type="noteref">2239</a> I never saw it before, and by the most ingenuous performance of the young jade Flora, it seemed as pretty a pleasant play as ever I saw in my life. So home to supper, and then to my office late, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Andrews and I to talk about our victualling commission, and then he being gone I to set down my four days past journalls and expenses, and so home to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-19">9th</time>. Up, and to my office, and there we sat all the morning, at noon home, and there by appointment <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave came and dined with me, and brought a friend of his of the Chapel with him. Very merry at dinner, and then up to my chamber and there we sung a Psalm or two of Lawes’s, then he and I a little talk by ourselves of his kinswoman that is to come to live with my wife, who is to come about ten days hence, and I hope will do well. They gone I to my office, and there my head being a little troubled with the little wine I drank, though mixed with beer, but it may be a little more than I used to do, and yet I cannot say so, I went home and spent the afternoon with my wife talking, and then in the evening a little to my office, and so home to supper and to bed. This day comes the news that the Emperour hath beat the Turke;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2240" id="noteref-2240" epub:type="noteref">2240</a> killed the Grand Vizier and several great Bassas, with an army of 80,000 men killed and routed; with some considerable loss of his own side, having lost three generals, and the French forces all cut off almost. Which is thought as good a service to the Emperour as beating the Turke almost, for had they conquered they would have been as troublesome to him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2241" id="noteref-2241" epub:type="noteref">2241</a></p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1664-8-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-20">10th</time>. Up, and, being ready, abroad to do several small businesses, among others to find out one to engrave my tables upon my new sliding rule with silver plates, it being so small that Browne that made it cannot get one to do it. So I find out Cocker,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2242" id="noteref-2242" epub:type="noteref">2242</a> the famous writing-master, and get him to do it, and I set an hour by him to see him design it all; and strange it is to see him with his natural eyes to cut so small at his first designing it, and read it all over, without any missing, when for my life I could not, with my best skill, read one word or letter of it; but it is use. But he says that the best light for his life to do a very small thing by (contrary to Chaucer’s words to the Sun, “that he should lend his light to them that small seals grave”),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2243" id="noteref-2243" epub:type="noteref">2243</a> it should be by an artificial light of a candle, set to advantage, as he could do it. I find the fellow, by his discourse, very ingenuous; and among other things, a great admirer and well read in all our English poets, and undertakes to judge of them all, and that not impertinently. Well pleased with his company and better with his judgement upon my Rule, I left him and home, whither <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deane by agreement came to me and dined with me, and by chance Gunner Batters’s wife. After dinner Deane and I [had] great discourse again about my Lord Chancellor’s timber, out of which I wish I may get well. Thence I to Cocker’s again, and sat by him with good discourse again for an hour or two, and then left him, and by agreement with Captain Silas Taylor (my old acquaintance at the Exchequer) to the Post Office<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2244" id="noteref-2244" epub:type="noteref">2244</a> to hear some instrument musique of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Berchenshaw’s before my Lord Brunkard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2245" id="noteref-2245" epub:type="noteref">2245</a> and Sir Robert Murray. I must confess, whether it be that I hear it but seldom, or that really voice is better, but so it is that I found no pleasure at all in it, and methought two voyces were worth twenty of it. So home to my office a while, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-21" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-21">11th</time>. Up, and through pain, to my great grief forced to wear my gowne to keep my legs warm. At the office all the morning, and there a high dispute against Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn about the breadth of canvas again, they being for the making of it narrower, I and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes for the keeping it broader. So home to dinner, and by and by comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, lately come from the Downes, and dined with me. I show him a good countenance, but love him not for his base ingratitude to me. However, abroad, carried my wife to buy things at the New Exchange, and so to my Lady Sandwich’s, and there merry, talking with her a great while, and so home, whither comes Cocker with my rule, which he hath engraved to admiration, for goodness and smallness of work: it cost me 14<abbr>s.</abbr> the doing, and mightily pleased I am with it. By and by, he gone, comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore and stayed talking with me a great while about my Lord’s businesses, which I fear will be in a bad condition for his family if my Lord should miscarry at sea. He gone, I late to my office, and cannot forbear admiring and consulting my new rule, and so home to supper and to bed. This day, for a wager before the King, my Lords of Castlehaven and Arran (a son of my Lord of Ormond’s), they two alone did run down and kill a stoute bucke in <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s park.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-22">12th</time>. Up, and all the morning busy at the office with Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Warren about a great contract for New England masts, where I was very hard with him, even to the making him angry, but I thought it fit to do it as well as just for my owne [and] the King’s behalf. At noon to the ’Change a little, and so to dinner and then out by coach, setting my wife and maid down, going to Stevens the silversmith to change some old silver lace and to go buy new silke lace for a petticoat; I to Whitehall and did much business at a Tangier Committee; where, among other things, speaking about propriety of the houses there, and how we ought to let the Portugeses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2246" id="noteref-2246" epub:type="noteref">2246</a> have right done them, as many of them as continue, or did sell the houses while they were in possession, and something further in their favour, the Duke in an anger I never observed in him before, did cry, says he, “All the world rides us, and I think we shall never ride anybody.” Thence home, and, though late, yet Pedro being there, he sang a song and parted. I did give him 5<abbr>s.</abbr>, but find it burdensome and so will break up the meeting. At night is brought home our poor Fancy, which to my great grief continues lame still, so that I wish she had not been brought ever home again, for it troubles me to see her.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-23">13th</time>. Up, and before I went to the office comes my Taylor with a coat I have made to wear within doors, purposely to come no lower than my knees, for by my wearing a gowne within doors comes all my tenderness about my legs. There comes also <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reeve, with a microscope and scotoscope.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2247" id="noteref-2247" epub:type="noteref">2247</a> For the first I did give him £5 10<abbr>s.</abbr>, a great price, but a most curious bauble it is, and he says, as good, nay, the best he knows in England, and he makes the best in the world. The other he gives me, and is of value; and a curious curiosity it is to look objects in a dark room with. Mightly pleased with this I to the office, where all the morning. There offered by Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn his coach to go to Epsum and carry my wife, I stepped out and bade my wife make her ready, but being not very well and other things advising me to the contrary, I did forbear going, and so <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed dining with me I got him to give my wife and me a play this afternoon, lending him money to do it, which is a fallacy that I have found now once, to avoyde my vowe with, but never to be more practised I swear, and to the new play, at the Duke’s house, of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Henry the Fifth</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2248" id="noteref-2248" epub:type="noteref">2248</a> a most noble play, writ by my Lord Orrery; wherein Betterton, Harris, and Ianthe’s parts are most incomparably wrote and done, and the whole play the most full of height and raptures of wit and sense, that ever I heard; having but one incongruity, or what did not please me in it, that is, that King Harry promises to plead for Tudor to their Mistresse, Princesse Katherine of France, more than when it comes to it he seems to do; and Tudor refused by her with some kind of indignity, not with a difficulty and honour that it ought to have been done in to him. Thence home and to my office, wrote by the post, and then to read a little in <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Power’s book of discovery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2249" id="noteref-2249" epub:type="noteref">2249</a> by the Microscope to enable me a little how to use and what to expect from my glasse. So to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-24">14th (Lord’s day)</time>. After long lying discoursing with my wife, I up, and comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Holliard to see me, who concurs with me that my pain is nothing but cold in my legs breeding wind, and got only by my using to wear a gowne, and that I am not at all troubled with any ulcer, but my thickness of water comes from my overheat in my back. He gone, comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Herbert, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Honiwood’s man, and dined with me, a very honest, plain, well-meaning man, I think him to be; and by his discourse and manner of life, the true embleme of an old ordinary serving-man. After dinner up to my chamber and made an end of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Power’s booke of the Microscope, very fine and to my content, and then my wife and I with great pleasure, but with great difficulty before we could come to find the manner of seeing anything by my microscope. At last did with good content, though not so much as I expect when I come to understand it better. By and by comes <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Joyce, in his silke suit, and cloake lined with velvett: stayed talking with me, and I very merry at it. He supped with me; but a cunning, crafty fellow he is, and dangerous to displease, for his tongue spares nobody. After supper I up to read a little, and then to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-25">15th</time>. Up, and with Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes by coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and there did our business with the Duke, who tells us more and more signs of a Dutch warr, and how we must presently set out a fleet for Guinny, for the Dutch are doing so, and there I believe the warr will begin. Thence home with him again, in our way he talking of his cures abroad, while he was with the King as a doctor, and above all men the pox. And among others, Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Denham he told me he had cured, after it was come to an ulcer all over his face, to a miracle. To the Coffeehouse I, and so to the ’Change a little, and then home to dinner with Creed, whom I met at the Coffeehouse, and after dinner by coach set him down at the Temple, and I and my wife to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave’s. They being none of them at home, I to the Hall, leaving her there, and thence to the Trumpett, whither came <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lane, and there begins a sad story how her husband, as I feared, proves not worth a farthing, and that she is with child and undone, if I do not get him a place. I had my pleasure here of her, and she, like an impudent jade, depends upon my kindness to her husband, but I will have no more to do with her, let her brew as she has baked, seeing she would not take my counsel about Hawly. After drinking we parted, and I to Blagrave’s, and there discoursed with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Blagrave about her kinswoman, who it seems is sickly even to frantiqueness sometimes, and among other things chiefly from love and melancholy upon the death of her servant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2250" id="noteref-2250" epub:type="noteref">2250</a> insomuch that she telling us all most simply and innocently I fear she will not be able to come to us with any pleasure, which I am sorry for, for I think she would have pleased us very well. In comes he, and so to sing a song and his niece with us, but she sings very meanly. So through the Hall and thence by coach home, calling by the way at Charing Crosse, and there saw the great Dutchman that is come over, under whose arm I went with my hat on, and could not reach higher than his eye-browes with the tip of my fingers, reaching as high as I could. He is a comely and well-made man, and his wife a very little, but pretty comely Dutch woman. It is true, he wears pretty high-heeled shoes, but not very high, and do generally wear a turbant, which makes him show yet taller than really he is, though he is very tall, as I have said before. Home to my office, and then to supper, and then to my office again late, and so home to bed, my wife and I troubled that we do not speed better in this business of her woman.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-26">16th</time>. Wakened about two o’clock this morning with the noise of thunder, which lasted for an houre, with such continued lightnings, not flashes, but flames, that all the sky and ayre was light; and that for a great while, not a minute’s space between new flames all the time; such a thing as I never did see, nor could have believed had ever been in nature. And being put into a great sweat with it, could not sleep till all was over. And that accompanied with such a storm of rain as I never heard in my life. I expected to find my house in the morning overflowed with the rain breaking in, and that much hurt must needs have been done in the city with this lightning; but I find not one drop of rain in my house, nor any news of hurt done. But it seems it has been here and all up and down the countrie hereabouts the like tempest, Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten saying much of the greatness thereof at Epsum. Up and all the morning at the office. At noon busy at the ’Change about one business or other, and thence home to dinner, and so to my office all the afternoon very busy, and so to supper anon, and then to my office again a while, collecting observations out of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Power’s booke of Microscopes, and so home to bed, very stormy weather tonight for winde. This day we had news that my Lady Penn is landed and coming hither, so that I hope the family will be in better order and more neate than it hath been.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-27">17th</time>. Up, and going to Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten to speak to him about business, he did give me three bottles of his Epsum water, which I drank and it wrought well with me, and did give me many good stools, and I found myself mightily cooled with them and refreshed. Thence I to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Honiwood and my father’s old house, but he was gone out, and there I stayed talking with his man Herbert, who tells me how Langford and his wife are very foul-mouthed people, and will speak very ill of my father, calling him old rogue in reference to the hard penniworths he sold him of his goods when the rogue need not have bought any of them. So that I am resolved he shall get no more money by me, but it vexes me to think that my father should be said to go away in debt himself, but that I will cause to be remedied whatever comes of it. Thence to my Lord Crew, and there with him a little while. Before dinner talked of the Dutch war, and find that he do much doubt that we shall fall into it without the money or consent of Parliament, that is expected or the reason of it that is fit to have for every warr. Dined with him, and after dinner talked with Sir Thomas Crew, who told me how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Montagu is forever blown up, and now quite out with his father again;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2251" id="noteref-2251" epub:type="noteref">2251</a> to whom he pretended that his going down was, not that he was cast out of the Court, but that he had leave to be absent a month; but now he finds the truth. Thence to my Lady Sandwich, where by agreement my wife dined, and after talking with her I carried my wife to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce’s and left her there, and so to Captain Cooke’s, but he was not at home, but I there spoke with my boy Tom Edwards, and directed him to go to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend (with whom I was in the morning) to have measure taken of his clothes to be made him there out of the Wardrobe, which will be so done, and then I think he will come to me. Thence to Whitehall, and after long staying there was no Committee of the Fishery as was expected. Here I walked long with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, who tells me the King do still sup every night with my Lady Castlemayne, who he believes has lately slunk a great belly away, for from very big she is come to be down again. Thence to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s, and with her and my wife to see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clarke, where with him and her very merry discoursing of the late play of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Henry the 5th</i>, which they conclude the best that ever was made, but confess with me that Tudor’s being dismissed in the manner he is is a great blemish to the play. I am mightily pleased with the Doctor, for he is the only man I know that I could learn to pronounce by, which he do the best that ever I heard any man. Thence home and to the office late, and so to supper and to bed. My Lady Penn came hither first tonight to Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn’s lodgings.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-28">18th</time>. Lay too long in bed, till 8 o’clock, then up and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reeve came and brought an anchor and a very fair loadstone. He would have had me bought it, and a good stone it is, but when he saw that I would not buy it he said he [would] leave it for me to sell for him. By and by he comes to tell me that he had present occasion for £6 to make up a sum, and that he would pay me in a day or two, but I had the unusual wit to deny him, and so by and by we parted, and I to the office, where busy all the morning sitting. Dined alone at home, my wife going today to dine with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce, and thence with her and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clerke to see a new play, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Court Secret</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2252" id="noteref-2252" epub:type="noteref">2252</a> I busy all the afternoon, toward evening to Westminster, and there in the Hall a while, and then to my barber, willing to have any opportunity to speak to Jane, but wanted it. So to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s, who was come home, and she and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clerke busy at cards, so my wife being gone home, I home, calling by the way at the Wardrobe and met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore and others at the Tavern thereby, and thither I to them and spoke with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend about my boy’s clothes, which he says shall be soon done, and then I hope I shall be settled when I have one in the house that is musicall.

Up and to the office, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn and I sat all the morning hiring of ships to go to Guinny, where we believe the warr with Holland will first break out. At noon dined at home, and after dinner my wife and I to Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn’s, to see his Lady,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2253" id="noteref-2253" epub:type="noteref">2253</a> the first time, who is a well-looked, fat, short, old Dutchwoman, but one that hath been heretofore pretty handsome, and is now very discreet, and, I believe, hath more wit than her husband. Here we stayed talking a good while, and very well pleased I was with the old woman at first visit. So away home, and I to my office, my wife to go see my aunt Wight, newly come to town. Creed came to me, and he and I out, among other things, to look out a man to make a case, for to keep my stone, that I was cut of, in, and he to buy Daniel’s history,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2254" id="noteref-2254" epub:type="noteref">2254</a> which he did, but I missed of my end. So parted upon Ludgate Hill, and I home and to the office, where busy till supper, and home to supper to a good dish of fritters, which I bespoke, and were done much to my mind. Then to the office a while again, and so home to bed. The news of the Emperour’s victory over the Turkes is by some doubted, but by most confessed to be very small (though great) of what was talked, which was 80,000 men to be killed and taken of the Turke’s side.</p>

Up and to the office a while, but this day the Parliament meeting only to be adjourned to November (which was done, accordingly), we did not meet, and so I forth to bespeak a case to be made to keep my stone in, which will cost me 25<abbr>s.</abbr> Thence I walked to Cheapside, there to see the effect of a fire there this morning, since four o’clock; which I find in the house of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bois, that married <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fuller’s niece, who are both out of town, leaving only a maid and man in town. It begun in their house, and hath burned much and many houses backward, though none forward; and that in the great uniform pile of buildings in the middle of Cheapside. I am very sorry for them, for the Doctor’s sake. Thence to the ’Change, and so home to dinner. And thence to Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, whither Sir Richard Ford came, the Sheriffe, who hath been at this fire all the while; and he tells me, upon my question, that he and the Mayor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2255" id="noteref-2255" epub:type="noteref">2255</a> were there, as it is their dutys to be, not only to keep the peace, but they have power of commanding the pulling down of any house or houses, to defend the whole City. By and by comes in the Common Cryer of the City to speak with him; and when he was gone, says he, “You may see by this man the constitution of the Magistracy of this City; that this fellow’s place, I dare give him (if he will be true to me) £1,000 for his profits every year, and expect to get £500 more to myself thereby. When,” says he, “I in myself am forced to spend many times as much.” By and by came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and so we met at the office, to hire ships for Guinny, and that done broke up. I to Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, there to discourse with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Falconer, who hath been with Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn this evening, after <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry had promised her half what <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Bodham had given him for his place, but Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn, though he knows that, and that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bodham hath said that his place hath cost him £100 and would £100 more, yet is he so high against the poor woman that he will not hear to give her a farthing, but it seems do listen after a lease where he expects <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer hath put in his daughter’s life, and he is afraid that that is not done, and did tell <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Falconer that he would see it and know what is done therein in spite of her, when, poor wretch, she neither do nor can hinder him the knowing it. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry knows of this business of the lease, and I believe do think of it as well as I. But the poor woman is gone home without any hope, but only <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry’s own nobleness. So I to my office and wrote many letters, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

So to sleep again, and then lay talking till 9 o’clock. So up and drunk three bottles of Epsum water, which wrought well with me. I all the morning and most of the afternoon after dinner putting papers to rights in my chamber, and the like in the evening till night at my office, and renewing and writing fair over my vowes.

Home to dinner, and so to Whitehall, setting down my wife at her father’s, and I to the Tangier Committee, where several businesses I did to my mind, and with hopes thereby to get something. So to Westminster Hall, where by appointment I had made I met with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Tom Pepys, but avoided all discourse of difference with him, though much against my will, and he like a doting coxcomb as he is, said he could not but demand his money, and that he would have his right, and that let all anger be forgot, and such sorry stuff, nothing to my mind, but only I obtained this satisfaction, that he told me about Sturbridge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2257" id="noteref-2257" epub:type="noteref">2257</a> last was 12 months or 2 years he was at Brampton, and there my father did tell him that what he had done for my brother in giving him his goods and setting him up as he had done was upon condition that he should give my brother John £20 per <abbr>ann.</abbr>, which he charged upon my father, he tells me in answer, as a great deal of hard measure that he should expect that with him that had a brother so able as I am to do that for him. This is all that he says he can say as to my father’s acknowledging that he had given Tom his goods. He says his brother Roger will take his oath that my father hath given him thanks for his counsel for his giving of Tom his goods and setting him up in the manner that he hath done, but the former part of this he did not speak fully so bad nor as certain what he could say. So we walked together to my cousin Joyce’s, where my wife stayed for me, and then I home and her by coach, and so to my office, then to supper and to bed.</p>

But that went over and friends again, and so she be well qualitied, I care not much whether she be French or no, so a Protestant. Thence to the office, and at noon to the ’Change, where very busy getting ships for Guinny and for Tangier. So home to dinner, and then abroad all the afternoon doing several errands, to comply with my oath of ending many businesses before Bartholomew’s day, which is two days hence. Among others I went into New Bridewell, in my way to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole, and there I saw the new model, and it is very handsome. Several at work, among others, one pretty whore brought in last night, which works very lazily. I did give them 6<abbr>d.</abbr> to drink, and so away. To Graye’s Inn, but missed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole, and so homeward called at Harman’s, and there bespoke some chairs for a room, and so home, and busy late, and then to supper and to bed.

So after ’Change home and a good dinner, and then to Whitehall to a Committee of the Fishery, where my Lord Craven and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gray mightily against <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed’s being joined in the warrant for Secretary with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Duke. However I did get it put off till the Duke of York was there, and so broke up doing nothing.

				<p><time datetime="1664-09-04">25th</time>. Up and to the office after I had spoke to my taylor, Langford (who came to me about some work), desiring to know whether he knew of any debts that my father did owe of his own in the City. He tells me, “No, not any.” I did on purpose try him because of what words he and his wife have said of him (as Herbert told me the other day), and further did desire him, that if he knew of any or could hear of any that he should bid them come to me, and I would pay them, for I would not that because he do not pay my brother’s debts that therefore he should be thought to deny the payment of his owne. All the morning at the office busy. At noon to the ’Change, among other things busy to get a little by the hire of a ship for Tangier. So home to dinner, and after dinner comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke to see me; it is true he was kind to me at sea in carrying messages to and fro to my wife from sea, but I did do him kindnesses too, and therefore I matter not much to compliment or make any regard of his thinking me to slight him as I do for his folly about my brother Tom’s mistress. After dinner and some talk with him, I to my office; there busy, till by and by Jacke Noble came to me to tell me that he had Cave in prison, and that he would give me and my father good security that neither we nor any of our family should be troubled with the child; for he could prove that he was fully satisfied for him; and that if the worst came to the worst, the parish must keep it; that Cave did bring the child to his house, but they got it carried back again, and that thereupon he put him in prison. When he saw that I would not pay him the money, nor made anything of being secured against the child, he then said that then he must go to law, not himself, but come in as a witness for Cave against us. I could have told him that he could bear witness that Cave is satisfied, or else there is no money due to himself; but I let alone any such discourse, only getting as much out of him as I could. I perceive he is a rogue, and hath inquired into everything and consulted with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pepys, and that he thinks as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pepys told him that my father if he could would not pay a farthing of the debts, and yet I made him confess that in all his lifetime he never knew my father to be asked for money twice, nay, not once, all the time he lived with him, and that for his own debts he believed he would do so still, but he meant only for those of Tom. He said now that Randall and his wife and the midwife could prove from my brother’s own mouth that the child was his, and that Tom had told them the circumstances of time, upon November 5th at night, that he got it on her. I offered him if he would secure my father against being forced to pay the money again I would pay him, which at first he would do, give his own security, and when I asked more than his own he told me yes he would, and those able men, subsidy men, but when we came by and by to discourse of it again he would not then do it, but said he would take his course, and joyne with Cave and release him, and so we parted. However, this vexed me so as I could not be quiet, but took coach to go speak with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole, but met him not within, so back, buying a table by the way, and at my office late, and then home to supper and to bed, my mind disordered about this roguish business⁠—in everything else, I thank God, well at ease.</p>

Thence to the ropeyard, and there among other things discoursed with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Falconer, who tells me that she has found the writing, and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Penn’s daughter is not put into the lease for her life as he expected, and I am glad of it. Thence to the Dockyarde, and there saw the new ship in very great forwardness, and so by water to Deptford a little, and so home and shifting myself, to the ’Change, and there did business, and thence down by water to Whitehall, by the way, at the Three Cranes, putting into an alehouse and eat a bit of bread and cheese. There I could not get into the Park, and so was fain to stay in the gallery over the gate to look to the passage into the Park, into which the King hath forbid of late anybody’s coming, to watch his coming that had appointed me to come, which he did by and by with his lady and went to Guardener’s Lane,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2258" id="noteref-2258" epub:type="noteref">2258</a> and there instead of meeting with one that was handsome and could play well, as they told me, she is the ugliest beast and plays so basely as I never heard anybody, so that I should loathe her being in my house. However, she took us by and by and showed us indeed some pictures at one Hiseman’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2259" id="noteref-2259" epub:type="noteref">2259</a> a picture drawer, a Dutchman, which is said to exceed Lilly, and indeed there is both of the Queenes and Maids of Honour (particularly <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stewart’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2260" id="noteref-2260" epub:type="noteref">2260</a> in a buff doublet like a soldier) as good pictures, I think, as ever I saw.

I was mightily pleased with this sight indeed, and so back again to their lodgings, where I left them, but before I went this mare that carried me, whose name I know not but that they call him Sir John, a pitiful fellow, whose face I have long known but upon what score I know not, but he could have the confidence to ask me to lay down money for him to renew the lease of his house, which I did give eare to there because I was there receiving a civility from him, but shall not part with my money. There I left them, and I by water home, where at my office busy late, then home to supper, and so to bed. This day my wife tells me <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Penn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2262" id="noteref-2262" epub:type="noteref">2262</a> Sir William’s son, is come back from France, and come to visit her.

Off the ’Change with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cutler and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Rider to Cutler’s house, and there had a very good dinner, and two or three pretty young ladies of their relations there.

Spent much of the afternoon to set his chamber in order, and then to the office leaving him at home, and late at night after all business was done I called Will and told him my reason of taking a boy, and that it is of necessity, not out of any unkindness to him, nor should be to his injury, and then talked about his landlord’s daughter to come to my wife, and I think it will be. So home and find my boy a very schoole boy, that talks innocently and impertinently, but at present it is a sport to us, and in a little time he will leave it. So sent him to bed, he saying that he used to go to bed at eight o’clock, and then all of us to bed, myself pretty well pleased with my choice of a boy. All the news this day is, that the Dutch are, with twenty-two sayle of ships of warr, crewsing up and down about Ostend; at which we are alarmed. My Lord Sandwich is come back into the Downes with only eight sayle, which is or may be a prey to the Dutch, if they knew our weakness and inability to set out any more speedily.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-09-07">28th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up the first time I have had great while. Home to dined, and with my boy alone to church anybody to attend me to church a dinner, and there met Creed, who, and we merry together, as his learning is such and judgment that I cannot but be pleased with it. After dinner I took him to church, into our gallery, with me, but slept the best part of the sermon, which was a most silly one. So he and I to walk to the ’Change a while, talking from one pleasant discourse to another, and so home, and thither came my uncle Wight and aunt, and supped with us mighty merry. And Creed lay with us all night, and so to bed, very merry to think how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Holliard (who came in this evening to see me) makes nothing, but proving as a most clear thing that Rome is Antichrist.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-09-08">29th</time>. Up betimes, intending to do business at my office, by 5 o’clock, but going out met at my door <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hughes come to speak with me about office business, and told me that as he came this morning from Deptford he left the King’s yarde afire. So I presently took a boat and down, and there found, by God’s providence, the fire out; but if there had been any wind it must have burned all our stores, which is a most dreadfull consideration. But leaving all things well I home, and out abroad doing many errands, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed also out, and my wife to her mother’s, and Creed and I met at my Lady Sandwich’s and there dined; but my Lady is become as handsome, I think, as ever she was; and so good and discreet a woman I know not in the world. After dinner I to Westminster to Jervas’s a while, and so doing many errands by the way, and necessary ones, I home, and thither came the woman with her mother which our Will recommends to my wife. I like her well, and I think will please us. My wife and they agreed, and she is to come the next week. At which I am very well contented, for then I hope we shall be settled, but I must remember that, never since I was housekeeper, I ever lived so quietly, without any noise or one angry word almost, as I have done since my present maids Besse, Jane, and Susan came and were together. Now I have taken a boy and am taking a woman, I pray God we may not be worse, but I will observe it. After being at my office a while, home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-09-09">30th</time>. Up and to the office, where sat long, and at noon to dinner at home; after dinner comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Penn to visit me, and stayed an houre talking with me. I perceive something of learning he hath got, but a great deal, if not too much, of the vanity of the French garbe and affected manner of speech and gait. I fear all real profit he hath made of his travel will signify little. So, he gone, I to my office and there very busy till late at night, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-09-10">31st</time>. Up by five o’clock and to my office, where <abbr class="name">T.</abbr> Hater and Will met me, and so we dispatched a great deal of my business as to the ordering my papers and books which were behindhand. All the morning very busy at my office. At noon home to dinner, and there my wife hath got me some pretty good oysters, which is very soon and the soonest, I think, I ever eat any. After dinner I up to hear my boy play upon a lute, which I have this day borrowed of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hunt; and indeed the boy would, with little practice, play very well upon the lute, which pleases me well. So by coach to the Tangier Committee, and there have another small business by which I may get a little small matter of money. Stayed but little there, and so home and to my office, where late casting up my monthly accounts, and, blessed be God! find myself worth £1,020, which is still the most I ever was worth. So home and to bed. Prince Rupert I hear this day is to go to command this fleet going to Guinny against the Dutch. I doubt few will be pleased with his going, being accounted an unhappy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2264" id="noteref-2264" epub:type="noteref">2264</a> man. My mind at good rest, only my father’s troubles with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pepys and my brother Tom’s creditors in general do trouble me. I have got a new boy that understands musique well, as coming to me from the King’s Chapel, and I hope will prove a good boy, and my wife and I are upon having a woman, which for her content I am contented to venture upon the charge of again, and she is one that our Will finds out for us, and understands a little musique, and I think will please us well, only her friends live too near us. Pretty well in health, since I left off wearing of a gowne within doors all day, and then go out with my legs into the cold, which brought me daily pain.</p>
