				<p><time datetime="1661-02-11">February 1st (Friday)</time>. A full office all this morning, and busy about answering the Commissioners of Parliament to their letter, wherein they desire to borrow two clerks of ours, which we will not grant them. After dinner into London and bought some books, and a belt, and had my sword new furbished. To the alehouse with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brigden and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Symons. At night home. So after a little music to bed, leaving my people up getting things ready against tomorrow’s dinner.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-2-12" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-02-12">2nd</time>. Early to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, and with him to Sir Peter Ball,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-915" id="noteref-915" epub:type="noteref">915</a> who proffers my uncle Robert much civility in letting him continue in the grounds which he had hired of Hetley who is now dead. Thence home, where all things in a hurry for dinner, a strange cook being come in the room of Slater, who could not come. There dined here my uncle Wight and my aunt, my father and mother, and my brother Tom, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fairbrother and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills, the parson, and his wife, who is a neighbour’s daughter of my uncle Robert’s, and knows my Aunt Wight and all her and my friends there; and so we had excellent company today. After dinner I was sent for to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s, where he was, and I found the Comptroller, who are upon writing a letter to the Commissioners of Parliament in some things a rougher stile than our last, because they seem to speak high to us. So the Comptroller and I thence to a tavern hard by, and there did agree upon drawing up some letters to be sent to all the pursers and Clerks of the Cheques to make up their accounts. Then home; where I found the parson and his wife gone. And by and by the rest of the company, very well pleased, and I too; it being the last dinner I intend to make a great while, it having now cost me almost £15 in three dinners within this fortnight. In the evening comes Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, pretty merry, to sit with me and talk, which we did for an hour or two, and so good night, and I to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-2-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-02-13">3rd (Lord’s day)</time>. This day I first begun to go forth in my coat and sword, as the manner now among gentlemen is. To Whitehall. In my way heard <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thomas Fuller preach at the Savoy upon our forgiving of other men’s trespasses, showing among other things that we are to go to law never to revenge, but only to repayre, which I think a good distinction. So to Whitehall; where I stayed to hear the trumpets and kettledrums, and then the other drums, which are much cried up, though I think it dull, vulgar music. So to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fox’s, unbid; where I had a good dinner and special company. Among other discourse, I observed one story, how my Lord of Northwich, at a public audience before the King of France, made the Duke of Anjou cry, by making ugly faces as he was stepping to the King, but undiscovered.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-916" id="noteref-916" epub:type="noteref">916</a> And how Sir Phillip Warwick’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-917" id="noteref-917" epub:type="noteref">917</a> lady did wonder to have <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Darcy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-918" id="noteref-918" epub:type="noteref">918</a> send for several dozen bottles of Rhenish wine to her house, not knowing that the wine was his. Thence to my Lord’s; where I am told how Sir Thomas Crew’s Pedro, with two of his countrymen more, did last night kill one soldier of four that quarrelled with them in the street, about 10 o’clock. The other two are taken; but he is now hid at my Lord’s till night, that he do intend to make his escape away. So up to my Lady, and sat and talked with her long, and so to Westminster Stairs, and there took boat to the bridge, and so home, where I met with letters to call us all up tomorrow morning to Whitehall about office business.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-2-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-02-14">4th</time>. Early up to Court with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, where, at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry’s chamber, we met with all our fellow officers, and there after a hot debate about the business of paying off the Fleet, and how far we should join with the Commissioners of Parliament, which is now the great business of this month more to determine, and about which there is a great deal of difference between us, and then how far we should be assistants to them therein. That being done, he and I back again home, where I met with my father and mother going to my cousin Snow’s to Blackwall, and had promised to bring me and my wife along with them, which we could not do because we are to go to the Dolphin today to a dinner of <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Tayler’s. So at last I let my wife go with them, and I to the tavern, where Sir William Penn and the Comptroller and several others were, men and women; and we had a very great and merry dinner; and after dinner the Comptroller begun some sports, among others the naming of people round and afterwards demanding questions of them that they are forced to answer their names to, which do make very good sport. And here I took pleasure to take the forfeits of the ladies who would not do their duty by kissing of them; among others a pretty lady, who I found afterwards to be wife to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s son.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-919" id="noteref-919" epub:type="noteref">919</a> Home, and then with my wife to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, who could not be with us this day being ill, but we found him at cards, and here we sat late, talking with my Lady and others and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Whistler,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-920" id="noteref-920" epub:type="noteref">920</a> who I found good company and a very ingenious man. So home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-2-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-02-15">5th</time>. Washing-day. My wife and I by water to Westminster. She to her mother’s and I to Westminster Hall, where I found a full term, and here I went to Will’s, and there found Shaw and Ashwell and another Bragrave (who knew my mother wash-maid to my Lady Veere), who by cursing and swearing made me weary of his company and so I went away. Into the Hall and there saw my Lord Treasurer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-921" id="noteref-921" epub:type="noteref">921</a> (who was sworn today at the Exchequer, with a great company of Lords and persons of honour to attend him) go up to the Treasury Offices, and take possession thereof; and also saw the heads of Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton, set up upon the further end of the Hall. Then at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Michell’s in the Hall met my wife and Shaw, and she and I and Captain Murford to the Dog, and there I gave them some wine, and after some mirth and talk (<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langley coming in afterwards) I went by coach to the playhouse at the Theatre, our coach in King Street breaking, and so took another. Here we saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Argalus and Parthenia</i>, which I lately saw, but though pleasant for the dancing and singing, I do not find good for any wit or design therein. That done home by coach and to supper, being very hungry for want of dinner, and so to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-2-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-02-16">6th</time>. Called up by my Cousin Snow, who sat by me while I was trimmed, and then I drank with him, he desiring a courtesy for a friend, which I have done for him. Then to the office, and there sat long, then to dinner, Captain Murford with me. I had a dish of fish and a good hare, which was sent me the other day by Goodenough the plasterer. So to the office again, where Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and I sat all alone, answering of petitions and nothing else, and so to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, where comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jessop (one whom I could not formerly have looked upon, and now he comes cap in hand to us from the Commissioners of the Navy, though indeed he is a man of a great estate and of good report), about some business from them to us, which we answered by letter. Here I sat long with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr>, who is not well, and then home and to my chamber, and some little, music, and so to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1661-2-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1661-02-17">7th</time>. With Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and Penn to Whitehall to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry’s chamber, to debate upon the business we were upon the other day morning, and thence to Westminster Hall. And after a walk to my Lord’s; where, while I and my Lady were in her chamber in talk, in comes my Lord from sea, to our great wonder. He had dined at Havre de Grace on Monday last, and came to the Downs the next day, and lay at Canterbury that night; and so to Dartford, and thence this morning to Whitehall. All my friends his servants well. Among others, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed and Captain Ferrers tell me the stories of my Lord Duke of Buckingham’s and my Lord’s falling out at Havre de Grace, at cards; they two and my Lord <abbr>St.</abbr> Alban’s playing. The Duke did, to my Lord’s dishonour, often say that he did in his conscience know the contrary to what he then said, about the difference at cards; and so did take up the money that he should have lost to my Lord. Which my Lord resenting, said nothing then, but that he doubted not but there were ways enough to get his money of him. So they parted that night; and my Lord sent for Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Stayner and sent him the next morning to the Duke, to know whether he did remember what he said last night, and whether he would own it with his sword and a second; which he said he would, and so both sides agreed. But my Lord <abbr>St.</abbr> Alban’s, and the Queen and Ambassador Montagu, did waylay them at their lodgings till the difference was made up, to my Lord’s honour; who hath got great reputation thereby. I dined with my Lord, and then with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley and Creed (who talked very high of France for a fine country) to the tavern, and then I home. To the office, where the two Sir Williams had stayed for me, and then we drew up a letter to the Commissioners of Parliament again, and so to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, where I stayed late in talk, and so home, and after writing the letter fair then I went to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-02-18">8th</time>. At the office all the morning. At noon to the Exchange to meet <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Warren the timber merchant, but could not meet with him. Here I met with many sea commanders, and among others Captain Cuttle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-922" id="noteref-922" epub:type="noteref">922</a> and Curtis, and Mootham,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-923" id="noteref-923" epub:type="noteref">923</a> and I, went to the Fleece Tavern to drink; and there we spent till four o’clock, telling stories of Algiers, and the manner of the life of slaves there.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-924" id="noteref-924" epub:type="noteref">924</a> And truly <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Mootham and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dawes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-925" id="noteref-925" epub:type="noteref">925</a> (who have been both slaves there) did make me fully acquainted with their condition there: as, how they eat nothing but bread and water. At their redemption they pay so much for the water they drink at the public fountaynes, during their being slaves. How they are beat upon the soles of their feet and bellies at the liberty of their padron. How they are all, at night, called into their master’s Bagnard;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-926" id="noteref-926" epub:type="noteref">926</a> and there they lie. How the poorest men do use their slaves best. How some rogues do live well, if they do invent to bring their masters in so much a week by their industry or theft; and then they are put to no other work at all. And theft there is counted no great crime at all. Thence to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson’s, having met my old friend Dick Scobell, and there I drank a great deal with him, and so home and to bed betimes, my head aching.</p>

To whom I did make known my fears of Will’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-927" id="noteref-927" epub:type="noteref">927</a> losing of his time, which he will take care to give him good advice about. Afterwards to my Lord’s and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley and I did make even his accounts and mine. And then with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed and two friends of his (my late landlord Jones’ son one of them), to an ordinary to dinner, and then Creed and I to Whitefriars<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-928" id="noteref-928" epub:type="noteref">928</a> to the Playhouse, and saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Mad Lover</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-929" id="noteref-929" epub:type="noteref">929</a> the first time I ever saw it acted, which I like pretty well, and home.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-02-20">10th (Lord’s day)</time>. Took physique all day, and, God forgive me, did spend it in reading of some little French romances. At night my wife and I did please ourselves talking of our going into France, which I hope to effect this summer. At noon one came to ask for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt that was here yesterday, and it seems is not come home yet, which makes us afraid of her. At night to bed.</p>

Here I stayed all the afternoon talking of the King’s being married, which is now the town talk, but I believe false. In the evening <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">The.</abbr> and Joyce took us all into the coach home, calling in Bishopsgate Street, thinking to have seen a new Harpsicon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-945" id="noteref-945" epub:type="noteref">945</a> that she had a making there, but it was not done, and so we did not see it.

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-05">23rd</time>. This my birthday, 28 years. This morning Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, Penn, and I did some business, and then I by water to Whitehall, having met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hartlibb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-946" id="noteref-946" epub:type="noteref">946</a> by the way at Alderman Backwell’s. So he did give me a glass of Rhenish wine at the Steeleyard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-947" id="noteref-947" epub:type="noteref">947</a> and so to Whitehall by water. He continues of the same bold impertinent humour that he was always of and will ever be. He told me how my Lord Chancellor had lately got the Duke of York and Duchess, and her woman, my Lord Ossory,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-948" id="noteref-948" epub:type="noteref">948</a> and a Doctor, to make oath before most of the judges of the kingdom, concerning all the circumstances of their marriage. And in fine, it is confessed that they were not fully married till about a month or two before she was brought to bed; but that they were contracted long before, and time enough for the child to be legitimate.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-949" id="noteref-949" epub:type="noteref">949</a> But I do not hear that it was put to the judges to determine whether it was so or no. To my Lord and there spoke to him about his opinion of the Light, the sea-mark that Captain Murford is about, and do offer me an eighth part to concern myself with it, and my Lord do give me some encouragement in it, and I shall go on. I dined herewith <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shepley and Howe. After dinner to Whitehall Chapel with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Child, and there did hear Captain Cooke and his boy make a trial of an Anthem against tomorrow, which was brave music. Then by water to Whitefriars to the Playhouse, and there saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Changeling</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-950" id="noteref-950" epub:type="noteref">950</a> the first time it hath been acted these twenty years, and it takes exceedingly. Besides, I see the gallants do begin to be tyred with the vanity and pride of the theatre actors who are indeed grown very proud and rich. Then by link home, and there to my book awhile and to bed. I met today with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend, who tells me that the old man is yet alive in whose place in the Wardrobe he hopes to get my father, which I do resolve to put for. I also met with the Comptroller, who told me how it was easy for us all, the principal officers, and proper for us, to labour to get into the next Parliament; and would have me to ask the Duke’s letter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-951" id="noteref-951" epub:type="noteref">951</a> but I shall not endeavour it because it will spend much money, though I am sure I could well obtain it. This is now 28 years that I am born. And blessed be God, in a state of full content, and great hopes to be a happy man in all respects, both to myself and friends.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-06">24th (Sunday)</time>. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills made as excellent a sermon in the morning against drunkenness as ever I heard in my life. I dined at home; another good one of his in the afternoon. My Valentine had her fine gloves on at church today that I did give her. After sermon my wife and I unto Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Batten and sat awhile. Then home, I to read, then to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-07">25th</time>. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Penn and I to my Lord Sandwich’s by coach in the morning to see him, but he takes physic today and so we could not see him. So he went away, and I with Luellin to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mount’s chamber at the Cockpit, where he did lie of old, and there we drank, and from thence to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Symons where we found him abroad, but she, like a good lady, within, and there we did eat some nettle porrige, which was made on purpose today for some of their coming, and was very good. With her we sat a good while, merry in discourse, and so away, Luellin and I to my Lord’s, and there dined. He told me one of the prettiest stories, how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blurton, his friend that was with him at my house three or four days ago, did go with him the same day from my house to the Fleet tavern by Guildhall, and there (by some pretence) got the mistress of the house into their company, and by and by Luellin calling him Doctor she thought that he really was so, and did privately discover her disease to him, which was only some ordinary infirmity belonging to women, and he proffering her physic, she desired him to come some day and bring it, which he did. After dinner by water to the office, and there Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and I met and did business all the afternoon, and then I got him to my house and eat a lobster together, and so to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-08">26th (Shrove Tuesday)</time>. I left my wife in bed, being indisposed⁠ ⁠… I to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s, who I found busy with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">The.</abbr> and Joyce making of things ready for fritters, so to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crew’s and there delivered <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cotgrave’s Dictionary</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-952" id="noteref-952" epub:type="noteref">952</a> to my Lady Jemimah, and then with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore to my coz Tom Pepys, but he being out of town I spoke with his lady, though not of the business I went about, which was to borrow £1,000 for my Lord. Back to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s, where several friends, all strangers to me but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Armiger, dined. Very merry and the best fritters that ever I eat in my life. After that looked out at window; saw the flinging at cocks.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-953" id="noteref-953" epub:type="noteref">953</a> Then <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">The.</abbr> and I, and a gentleman that dined there and his daughter, a perfect handsome young and very tall lady that lately came out of the country, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thatcher the Virginall Maister to Bishopsgate Street, and there saw the new Harpsicon made for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">The.</abbr> We offered £12, they demanded £14. The Master not being at home, we could make no bargain, so parted for tonight. So all by coach to my house, where I found my Valentine with my wife, and here they drank, and then went away. Then I sat and talked with my Valentine and my wife a good while, and then saw her home, and went to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten to the Dolphin, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Newborne, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, were, and there after a quart or two of wine, we home, and I to bed.⁠ ⁠…</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-09">27th</time>. At the office all the morning, that done I walked in the garden with little Captain Murford, where he and I had some discourse concerning the Light-House again, and I think I shall appear in the business, he promising me that if I can bring it about, it will be worth £100 per annum. Then came into the garden to me young <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Powell and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hooke that I once knew at Cambridge, and I took them in and gave them a bottle of wine, and so parted. Then I called for a dish of fish, which we had for dinner, this being the first day of Lent; and I do intend to try whether I can keep it or no. My father dined with me and did show me a letter from my brother John, wherein he tells us that he is chosen Schollar of the house,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-954" id="noteref-954" epub:type="noteref">954</a> which do please me much, because I do perceive now it must chiefly come from his merit and not the power of his Tutor, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Widdrington, who is now quite out of interest there and hath put over his pupils to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepper, a young Fellow of the College. With my father to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson’s, where we met my uncle Wight, and after a pint or two away. I walked with my father (who gave me an account of the great falling out between my uncle Fenner and his son Will)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-955" id="noteref-955" epub:type="noteref">955</a> as far as Paul’s Churchyard, and so left him, and I home. This day the Commissioners of Parliament begin to pay off the Fleet, beginning with the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hampshire</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-956" id="noteref-956" epub:type="noteref">956</a> and do it at Guildhall, for fear of going out of town into the power of the seamen, who are highly incensed against them.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1661-03-10">28th</time>. Early to wait on my Lord, and after a little talk with him I took boat at Whitehall for Redriffe, but in my way overtook Captain Cuttance and Teddiman in a boat and so ashore with them at Queenhithe, and so to a tavern with them to a barrel of oysters, and so away. <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Cuttance and I walked from Redriffe to Deptford, where I found both Sir Williams and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Uthwayt’s, and there we dined, and notwithstanding my resolution, yet for want of other victualls, I did eat flesh this Lent, but am resolved to eat as little as I can. After dinner we went to Captain Bodilaw’s, and there made sale of many old stores by the candle, and good sport it was to see how from a small matter bid at first they would come to double and treble the price of things. After that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and I and my Lady Batten and her daughter by land to Redriffe, staying a little at halfway house, and when we came to take boat, found Sir George, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, to have stayed with the barge a great while for us, which troubled us. Home and to bed. This month ends with two great secrets under dispute but yet known to very few: first, Who the King will marry; and What the meaning of this fleet is which we are now sheathing to set out for the southward. Most think against Algier against the Turk, or to the East Indies against the Dutch who, we hear, are setting out a great fleet thither.</p>
