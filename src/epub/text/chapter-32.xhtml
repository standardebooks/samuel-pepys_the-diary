				<p><time datetime="1662-08-11">August 1st</time>. Up, my head aching, and to my office, where Cooper read me another lecture upon my modell very pleasant. So to my business all the morning, which increases by people coming now to me to the office. At noon to the Exchange, where meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed and Moore we three to a house hard by (which I was not pleased with) to dinner, and after dinner and some discourse ordinary by coach home, it raining hard, and so at the office all the afternoon till evening to my chamber, where, God forgive me, I was sorry to hear that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s maid Betty was gone away yesterday, for I was in hopes to have had a bout with her before she had gone, she being very pretty. I had also a mind to my own wench, but I dare not for fear she should prove honest and refuse and then tell my wife. I stayed up late, putting things in order for my going to Chatham tomorrow, and so to bed, being in pain⁠ ⁠… with the little riding in a coach today from the Exchange, which do trouble me.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-12">2nd</time>. Up early, and got me ready in my riding clothes, and so to the office, and there wrote letters to my father and wife against night, and then to the business of my office, which being done, I took boat with Will, and down to Greenwich, where Captain Cocke not being at home I was vexed, and went to walk in the Park till he come thither to me: and Will’s forgetting to bring my boots in the boat did also vex me, for I was forced to send the boat back again for them. I to Captain Cocke’s along with him to dinner, where I find his lady still pretty, but not so good a humour as I thought she was. We had a plain, good dinner, and I see they do live very frugally. I eat among other fruit much mulberrys, a thing I have not eat of these many years, since I used to be at Ashted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1480" id="noteref-1480" epub:type="noteref">1480</a> at my cousin Pepys’s. After dinner we to boat, and had a pleasant passage down to Gravesend, but it was nine o’clock before we got thither, so that we were in great doubt what to do, whether to stay there or no; and the rather because I was afeard to ride, because of my pain⁠ ⁠… ; but at the Swan, finding <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hemson and Lieutenant Carteret<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1481" id="noteref-1481" epub:type="noteref">1481</a> of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Foresight</i> come to meet me, I borrowed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hemson’s horse, and he took another, and so we rode to Rochester in the dark, and there at the Crown <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gregory, Barrow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1482" id="noteref-1482" epub:type="noteref">1482</a> and others stayed to meet me. So after a glass of wine, we to our barge, that was ready for me, to the Hill-house, where we soon went to bed, before we slept I telling upon discourse Captain Cocke the manner of my being cut of the stone, which pleased him much. So to sleep.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-13">3rd (Lord’s day)</time>. Up early, and with Captain Cocke to the dockyard, a fine walk, and fine weather. Where we walked till Commissioner Pett come to us, and took us to his house, and showed us his garden and fine things, and did give us a fine breakfast of bread and butter, and sweetmeats and other things with great choice, and strong drinks, with which I could not avoyde making my head ake, though I drank but little. Thither came Captain Allen of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Foresight</i>, and the officers of the yard to see me. Thence by and by to church, by coach, with the Commissioner, and had a dull sermon. A full church, and some pretty women in it; among others, Beck Allen, who was a bride-maid to a new married couple that came to church today, and, which was pretty strange, sat in a pew hung with mourning for a mother of the bride’s, which methinks should have been taken down. After dinner going out of the church saluted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pett, who came after us in the coach to church, and other officers’ wives. The Commissioner stayed at dinner with me, and we had a good dinner, better than I would have had, but I saw there was no helping of it. After dinner the Commissioner and I left the company and walked in the garden at the Hill-house, which is very pleasant, and there talked of our businesses and matters of the navy. So to church again, where quite weary, and so after sermon walked with him to the yard up and down and the fields, and saw the place designed for the wet dock. And so to his house, and had a syllabub, and saw his closet, which come short of what I expected, but there was fine modells of ships in it indeed, whose worth I could not judge of. At night walked home to the Hill-house, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barrow with me, talking of the faults of the yard, walking in the fields an hour or two, and so home to supper, and so Captain Cocke and I to bed. This day among other stories he told me how despicable a thing it is to be a hangman in Poland, although it be a place of credit. And that, in his time, there was some repairs to be made of the gallows there, which was very fine of stone; but nobody could be got to mend it till the Burgomaster, or Mayor of the town, with all the companies of those trades which were necessary to be used about those repairs, did go in their habits with flags, in solemn procession to the place, and there the Burgomaster did give the first blow with the hammer upon the wooden work; and the rest of the Masters of the Companys upon the works belonging to their trades; that so workmen might not be ashamed to be employed upon doing of the gallows’ works.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-14">4th</time>. Up by four o’clock in the morning and walked to the Dock, where Commissioner Pett and I took barge and went to the guardships and mustered them, finding them but badly manned; thence to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Sovereign</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1483" id="noteref-1483" epub:type="noteref">1483</a> which we found kept in good order and very clean, which pleased us well, but few of the officers on board. Thence to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Charles</i>, and were troubled to see her kept so neglectedly by the boatswain Clements, who I always took for a very good officer; it is a very brave ship. Thence to Upnor Castle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1484" id="noteref-1484" epub:type="noteref">1484</a> and there went up to the top, where there is a fine prospect, but of very small force; so to the yard, and there mustered the whole ordinary, where great disorder by multitude of servants and old decrepid men, which must be remedied. So to all the storehouses and viewed the stores of all sorts and the hemp, where we found Captain Cocke’s (which he came down to see along with me) very bad, and some others, and with much content (God forgive me) I did hear by the Clerk of the Ropeyard how it was by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s private letter that one parcel of Alderman Barker’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1485" id="noteref-1485" epub:type="noteref">1485</a> was received. At two o’clock to dinner to the Hill-house, and after dinner dispatched many people’s business, and then to the yard again, and looked over <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gregory’s and Barrow’s houses to see the matter of difference between them concerning an alteration that Barrow would make, which I shall report to the board, but both their houses very pretty, and deserve to be so, being well kept. Then to a trial of several sorts of hemp, but could not perform it here so well as at Woolwich, but we did do it pretty well. So took barge at the dock and to Rochester, and there Captain Cocke and I and our two men took coach about 8 at night and to Gravesend, where it was very dark before we got thither to the Swan; and there, meeting with Doncaster, an old waterman of mine above bridge, we eat a short supper, being very merry with the drolling, drunken coachman that brought us, and so took water. It being very dark, and the wind rising, and our waterman unacquainted with this part of the river, so that we presently cast upon the Essex shore, but got off again, and so, as well as we could, went on, but I in such fear that I could not sleep till we came to Erith, and there it begun to be calm, and the stars to shine, and so I began to take heart again, and the rest too, and so made shift to slumber a little. Above Woolwich we lost our way, and went back to Blackwall, and up and down, being guided by nothing but the barking of a dog, which we had observed in passing by Blackwall, and so,</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-15">5th</time>. Got right again with much ado, after two or three circles and so on, and at Greenwich set in Captain Cocke, and I set forward, hailing to all the King’s ships at Deptford, but could not wake any man: so that we could have done what we would with their ships. At last waked one man; but it was a merchant ship, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Royal Catharine</i>: so to the Towerdock and home, where the girl sat up for me. It was about three o’clock, and putting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Boddam out of my bed, went to bed, and lay till nine o’clock, and so to the office, where we sat all the morning, and I did give some accounts of my service. Dined alone at home, and was glad my house is begun tiling. And to the office again all the afternoon, till it was so dark that I could not see hardly what it is that I now set down when I write this word, and so went to my chamber and to bed, being sleepy.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-16">6th</time>. Up early, and, going to my office, met Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret in coming through the yard, and so walked a good while talking with him about Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and find that he is going down the wind in everybody’s esteem, and in that of his honesty by this letter that he wrote to <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Allen concerning Alderman Barker’s hemp. Thence by water to Whitehall; and so to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s; but there found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry gone to Hampton Court. So to my Lord’s; and he is also gone: this being a great day at the Council about some business at the Council before the King. Here I met with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, the chirurgeon, who told me how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Montagu hath lately had a duell with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cholmely,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1486" id="noteref-1486" epub:type="noteref">1486</a> that is first gentleman-usher to the Queen, and was a messenger from the King to her in Portugal, and is a fine gentleman; but had received many affronts from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu, and some unkindness from my Lord, upon his score (for which I am sorry). He proved too hard for Montagu, and drove him so far backward that he fell into a ditch, and dropt his sword, but with honour would take no advantage over him; but did give him his life: and the world says <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu did carry himself very poorly in the business, and hath lost his honour forever with all people in it, of which I am very glad, in hopes that it will humble him. I hear also that he hath sent to my Lord to borrow £400, giving his brother Harvey’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1487" id="noteref-1487" epub:type="noteref">1487</a> security for it, and that my Lord will lend it him, for which I am sorry. Thence home, and at my office all the morning, and dined at home, and can hardly keep myself from having a mind to my wench, but I hope I shall not fall to such a shame to myself. All the afternoon also at my office, and did business. In the evening came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bland<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1488" id="noteref-1488" epub:type="noteref">1488</a> the merchant to me, who has lived long in Spain, and is concerned in the business of Tangier, who did discourse with me largely of it, and after he was gone did send me three or four printed things that he hath wrote of trade in general and of Tangier particularly, but I do not find much in them. This afternoon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waith was with me, and did tell me much concerning the Chest, which I am resolved to look into; and I perceive he is sensible of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s carriage; and is pleased to see anything work against him. Who, poor man, is, I perceive, much troubled, and did yesterday morning walk in the garden with me, did tell me he did see there was a design of bringing another man in his room, and took notice of my sorting myself with others, and that we did business by ourselves without him. Part of which is true, but I denied, and truly, any design of doing him any such wrong as that. He told me he did not say it particularly of me, but he was confident there was somebody intended to be brought in, nay, that the trayne was laid before Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn went, which I was glad to hear him say. Upon the whole I see he perceives himself tottering, and that he is suspected, and would be kind to me, but I do my business in the office and neglect him. At night writing in my study a mouse ran over my table, which I shut up fast under my shelf’s upon my table till tomorrow, and so home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-17">7th</time>. Up by four o’clock and to my office, and by and by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper comes and to our modell, which pleases me more and more. At this till 8 o’clock, and so we sat in the office and stayed all the morning, my interest still growing, for which God be praised. This morning I got unexpectedly the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Reserve</i> for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper to be maister of, which was only by taking an opportune time to motion [it], which is one good effect of my being constant at the office, that nothing passes without me; and I have the choice of my own time to propose anything I would have. Dined at home, and to the office again at my business all the afternoon till night, and so to supper and to bed. It being become a pleasure to me nowadays to follow my business, and the greatest part may be imputed to my drinking no wine, and going to no plays.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-18">8th</time>. Up by four o’clock in the morning, and at five by water to Woolwich, there to see the manner of tarring, and all the morning looking to see the several proceedings in making of cordage, and other things relating to that sort of works, much to my satisfaction. At noon came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry on purpose from Hampton Court to see the same, and dined with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer, and after dinner to several experiments of Hemp, and particularly some Milan hemp that is brought over ready dressed. Thence we walked talking, very good discourse all the way to Greenwich, and I do find most excellent discourse from him. Among other things, his rule of suspecting every man that proposes anything to him to be a knave; or, at least, to have some ends of his own in it. Being led thereto by the story of Sir John Millicent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1489" id="noteref-1489" epub:type="noteref">1489</a> that would have had a patent from King James for every man to have had leave to have given him a shilling; and that he might take it of every man that had a mind to give it, and being answered that that was a fair thing, but what needed he a patent for it, and what he would do to them that would not give him. He answered, he would not force them; but that they should come to the Council of State, to give a reason why they would not. Another rule is a proverb that he hath been taught, which is that a man that cannot sit still in his chamber (the reason of which I did not understand him), and he that cannot say no (that is, that is of so good a nature that he cannot deny anything, or cross another in doing anything), is not fit for business. The last of which is a very great fault of mine, which I must amend in. Thence by boat; I being hot, he put the skirt of his cloak about me; and it being rough, he told me the passage of a Frenchman through London Bridge, where, when he saw the great fall, he begun to cross himself and say his prayers in the greatest fear in the world, and soon as he was over, he swore “<i xml:lang="fr">Morbleu! c’est le plus grand plaisir du monde</i>,” being the most like a French humour in the world.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1490" id="noteref-1490" epub:type="noteref">1490</a> To Deptford, and there surprised the Yard, and called them to a muster, and discovered many abuses, which we shall be able to understand hereafter and amend. Thence walked to Redriffe, and so to London Bridge, where I parted with him, and walked home and did a little business, and to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-19">9th</time>. Up by four o’clock or a little after, and to my office, whither by and by comes Cooper, to whom I told my getting for him the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Reserve</i>, for which he was very thankful, and fell to work upon our modell, and did a good morning’s work upon the rigging, and am very sorry that I must lose him so soon. By and by comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and he and I alone sat at the office all the morning upon business. And so to dinner to Trinity House, and thence by his coach towards Whitehall; but there being a stop at the Savoy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1491" id="noteref-1491" epub:type="noteref">1491</a> we ’light and took water, and my Lord Sandwich being out of town, we parted there, all the way having good discourse, and in short I find him the most ingenuous person I ever found in my life, and am happy in his acquaintance and my interest in him. Home by water, and did business at my office. Writing a letter to my brother John to dissuade him from being Moderator of his year, which I hear is proffered him, of which I am very glad. By and by comes Cooper, and he and I by candlelight at my modell, being willing to learn as much of him as is possible before he goes. So home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-20">10th (Lord’s day)</time>. Being to dine at my brother’s, I walked to <abbr>St.</abbr> Dunstan’s, the church being now finished; and here I heard <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1492" id="noteref-1492" epub:type="noteref">1492</a> who made a most eloquent sermon; and I am sorry I have hitherto had so low an opinion of the man, for I have not heard a neater sermon a great while, and more to my content. So to Tom’s, where <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fairebrother, newly come from Cambridge, met me, and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Thomas Pepys. I framed myself as pleasant as I could, but my mind was another way. Hither came my uncle Fenner, hearing that I was here, and spoke to me about Pegg Kite’s business of her portion, which her husband demands, but I will have nothing to do with it. I believe he has no mind to part with the money out of his hands, but let him do what he will with it. He told me the new service-book<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1493" id="noteref-1493" epub:type="noteref">1493</a> (which is now lately come forth) was laid upon their deske at <abbr>St.</abbr> Sepulchre’s for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gouge to read; but he laid it aside, and would not meddle with it: and I perceive the Presbyters do all prepare to give over all against Bartholomew-tide.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1494" id="noteref-1494" epub:type="noteref">1494</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Herring, being lately turned out at <abbr>St.</abbr> Bride’s, did read the psalm to the people while they sung at <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bates’s, which methought is a strange turn. After dinner to <abbr>St.</abbr> Bride’s, and there heard one Carpenter, an old man, who, they say, hath been a Jesuit priest, and is come over to us; but he preaches very well. So home with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and there hear that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Calamy hath taken his farewell this day of his people, and that others will do so the next Sunday. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Turner,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1495" id="noteref-1495" epub:type="noteref">1495</a> the draper, I hear, is knighted, made Alderman, and pricked for Sheriffe, with Sir Thomas Bluddel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1496" id="noteref-1496" epub:type="noteref">1496</a> for the next year, by the King, and so are called with great honour the King’s Sheriffes. Thence walked home, meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore by the way, and he home with me and walked till it was dark in the garden, and so good night, and I to my closet in my office to perfect my Journall and to read my solemn vows, and so to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-21" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-21">11th</time>. All the morning at the office. Dined at home all alone, and so to my office again, whither Dean Fuller came to see me, and having business about a ship to carry his goods to Dublin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1497" id="noteref-1497" epub:type="noteref">1497</a> whither he is shortly to return, I went with him to the Hermitage, and the ship happening to be <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Holland’s I did give orders for them to be well looked after, and thence with him to the Custom House about getting a pass for them, and so to the Dolphin tavern, where I spent 6<abbr>d.</abbr> on him, but drank but one glass of wine, and so parted. He tells me that his niece, that sings so well, whom I have long longed to see, is married to one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Boys, a wholesale man at the Three Crowns in Cheapside. I to the office again, whither Cooper came and read his last lecture to me upon my modell, and so bid me goodbye, he being to go tomorrow to Chatham to take charge of the ship I have got him. So to my business till 9 at night, and so to supper and to bed, my mind a little at ease because my house is now quite tiled.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-22">12th</time>. Up early at my office, and I find all people beginning to come to me. Among others <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deane,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1498" id="noteref-1498" epub:type="noteref">1498</a> the Assistant of Woolwich, who I find will discover to me the whole abuse that his Majesty suffers in the measuring of timber, of which I shall be glad. He promises me also a modell of a ship, which will please me exceedingly, for I do want one of my own. By and by we sat, and among other things Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and I had a difference about his clerk’s making a warrant for a Maister, which I would not suffer, but got another signed, which he desires may be referred to a full board, and I am willing to it. But though I did get another signed of my own clerk’s, yet I will give it to his clerk, because I would not be judged unkind, and though I will stand upon my privilege. At noon home and to dinner alone, and so to the office again, where busy all the afternoon till 10 o’clock at night, and so to supper and to bed, my mind being a little disquieted about Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s dispute today, though this afternoon I did speak with his man Norman at last, and told him the reason of my claim.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-23">13th</time>. Up early, and to my office, where people come to me about business, and by and by we met on purpose to enquire into the business of the flag-makers, where I am the person that do chiefly manage the business against them on the King’s part; and I do find it the greatest cheat that I have yet found; they having eightpence per yard allowed them by pretence of a contract, where no such thing appears; and it is threepence more than was formerly paid, and than I now offer the Board to have them done. We did not fully end it, but refer it to another time. At noon Commr. Pett and I by water to Greenwich, and on board the pleasure-boats to see what they wanted, they being ordered to sea, and very pretty things I still find them, and so on shore and at the Shipp had a bit of meat and dined, there waiting upon us a barber of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pett’s acquaintance that plays very well upon the violin. Thence to Lambeth; and there saw the little pleasure-boat in building by the King, my Lord Brunkard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1499" id="noteref-1499" epub:type="noteref">1499</a> and the virtuosoes of the town, according to new lines, which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pett cries up mightily, but how it will prove we shall soon see. So by water home, and busy at my study late, drawing a letter to the yards of reprehension and direction for the board to sign, in which I took great pains. So home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-24">14th</time>. Up early and to look on my works, and find my house to go on apace. So to my office to prepare business, and then we met and sat till noon, and then Commissioner Pett and I being invited, went by Sir John Winter’s coach sent for us, to the Mitre, in Fenchurch street, to a venison-pasty; where I found him a very worthy man; and good discourse. Most of which was concerning the Forest of Dean, and the timber there, and iron-workes with their great antiquity, and the vast heaps of cinders which they find, and are now of great value, being necessary for the making of iron at this day; and without which they cannot work: with the age of many trees there left at a great fall in Edward the Third’s time, by the name of forbid-trees, which at this day are called vorbid trees. Thence to my office about business till late, and so home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-25">15th</time>. Up very early, and up about seeing how my work proceeds, and am pretty well pleased therewith; especially my wife’s closet will be very pretty. So to the office and there very busy, and many people coming to me. At noon to the ’Change, and there hear of some Quakers that are seized on, that would have blown up the prison in Southwark where they are put. So to the Swan, in Old Fish Street, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brigden and his father-in-law, Blackbury, of whom we had bought timber in the office, but have not dealt well with us, did make me a fine dinner only to myself; and after dinner comes in a jugler, which showed us very pretty tricks. I seemed very pleasant, but am no friend to the man’s dealings with us in the office. After an hour or two sitting after dinner talking about office business, where I had not spent any time a great while, I went to Paul’s Church Yard to my bookseller’s; and there I hear that next Sunday will be the last of a great many Presbyterian ministers in town, who, I hear, will give up all. I pray God the issue may be good, for the discontent is great. Home and to my office till 9 at night doing business, and so to bed. My mind well pleased with a letter I found at home from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, expressing his satisfaction in a letter I writ last night, and sent him this morning, to be corrected by him in order to its sending down to all the Yards as a charge to them.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-27">17th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up very early, this being the last Sunday that the Presbyterians are to preach, unless they read the new Common Prayer and renounce the Covenant,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1500" id="noteref-1500" epub:type="noteref">1500</a> and so I had a mind to hear <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bates’s farewell sermon, and walked thither, calling first at my brother’s, where I found that he is come home after being a week abroad with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pepys, nobody knows where, nor I but by chance, that he was gone, which troubles me. So I called only at the door, but did not ask for him, but went to Madam Turner’s to know whether she went to church, and to tell her that I would dine with her; and so walked to <abbr>St.</abbr> Dunstan’s, where, it not being seven o’clock yet, the doors were not open; and so I went and walked an hour in the Temple-garden, reading my vows, which it is a great content to me to see how I am a changed man in all respects for the better, since I took them, which the God of Heaven continue to me, and make me thankful for. At eight o’clock I went, and crowded in at a back door among others, the church being half-full almost before any doors were open publicly; which is the first time that I have done so these many years since I used to go with my father and mother, and so got into the gallery, beside the pulpit, and heard very well. His text was, “Now the God of Peace⁠—;” the last Hebrews, and the 20th verse: he making a very good sermon, and very little reflections in it to anything of the times. Besides the sermon, I was very well pleased with the sight of a fine lady that I have often seen walk in Graye’s Inn Walks, and it was my chance to meet her again at the door going out, and very pretty and sprightly she is, and I believe the same that my wife and I some years since did meet at Temple Bar gate and have sometimes spoke of. So to Madam Turner’s, and dined with her. She had heard Parson Herring take his leave; tho’ he, by reading so much of the Common Prayer as he did, hath cast himself out of the good opinion of both sides. After dinner to <abbr>St.</abbr> Dunstan’s again; and the church quite crowded before I came, which was just at one o’clock; but I got into the gallery again, but stood in a crowd and did exceedingly sweat all the time. He pursued his text again very well; and only at the conclusion told us, after this manner: “I do believe that many of you do expect that I should say something to you in reference to the time, this being the last time that possibly I may appear here. You know it is not my manner to speak anything in the pulpit that is extraneous to my text and business; yet this I shall say, that it is not my opinion, fashion, or humour that keeps me from complying with what is required of us; but something which, after much prayer, discourse, and study yet remains unsatisfied, and commands me herein. Wherefore, if it is my unhappiness not to receive such an illumination as should direct me to do otherwise, I know no reason why men should not pardon me in this world, and am confident that God will pardon me for it in the next.” And so he concluded. Parson Herring read a psalm and chapters before sermon; and one was the chapter in the Acts, where the story of Ananias and Sapphira is. And after he had done, says he, “This is just the case of England at present. God he bids us to preach, and men bid us not to preach; and if we do, we are to be imprisoned and further punished. All that I can say to it is, that I beg your prayers, and the prayers of all good Christians, for us.” This was all the exposition he made of the chapter in these very words, and no more. I was much pleased with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bates’s manner of bringing in the Lord’s Prayer after his own; thus, “In whose comprehensive words we sum up all our imperfect desires; saying, ‘Our Father,’ ” <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Church being done and it raining I took a hackney coach and so home, being all in a sweat and fearful of getting cold. To my study at my office, and thither came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore to me and walked till it was quite dark. Then I wrote a letter to my Lord Privy Seale as from my Lord for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> ⸻ to be sworn directly by deputy to my Lord, he denying to swear him as deputy together with me. So that I am now clear of it, and the profit is now come to be so little that I am not displeased at my getting off so well. He being gone I to my study and read, and so to eat a bit of bread and cheese and so to bed. I hear most of the Presbyters took their leaves today, and that the City is much dissatisfied with it. I pray God keep peace among us, and make the Bishops careful of bringing in good men in their rooms, or else all will fly a-pieces; for bad ones will not [go] down with the City.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-28">18th</time>. Up very early, and up upon my house to see how work goes on, which do please me very well. So about seven o’clock took horse and rode to Bowe, and there stayed at the King’s Head, and eat a breakfast of eggs till <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deane of Woolwich came to me, and he and I rid into Waltham Forest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1501" id="noteref-1501" epub:type="noteref">1501</a> and there we saw many trees of the King’s a-hewing; and he showed me the whole mystery of off square,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1502" id="noteref-1502" epub:type="noteref">1502</a> wherein the King is abused in the timber that he buys, which I shall with much pleasure be able to correct. After we had been a good while in the wood, we rode to Illford, and there, while dinner was getting ready, he and I practised measuring of the tables and other things till I did understand measuring of timber and board very well. So to dinner and by and by, being sent for, comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooper, our officer in the Forest, and did give me an account of things there, and how the country is backward to come in with their carts. By and by comes one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Marshall, of whom the King has many carriages for his timber, and they stayed and drank with me, and while I am here, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten passed by in his coach, homewards from Colchester, where he had been seeing his son-in-law, Lemon, that lies a-dying, but I would take no notice of him, but let him go. By and by I got a horseback again and rode to Barking, and there saw the place where they ship this timber for Woolwich; and so Deane and I home again, and parted at Bowe, and I home just before a great showre of rayne, as God would have it. I find Deane a pretty able man, and able to do the King service; but, I think, more out of envy to the rest of the officers of the yard, of whom he complains much, than true love, more than others, to the service. He would fain seem a modest man, and yet will commend his own work and skill, and vie with other persons, especially the Petts, but I let him alone to hear all he will say. Whiled away the evening at my office trying to repeat the rules of measuring learnt this day, and so to bed with my mind very well pleased with this day’s work.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-29">19th</time>. Up betimes and to see how my work goes on. Then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed came to me, and he and I walked an hour or two till 8 o’clock in the garden, speaking of our accounts one with another and then things public. Among other things he tells me that my Lord has put me into Commission with himself and many noblemen and others for Tangier, which, if it be, is not only great honour, but may be of profit too, and I am very glad of it. By and by to sit at the office; and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry did tell us of the duell between <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jermyn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1503" id="noteref-1503" epub:type="noteref">1503</a> nephew to my Lord <abbr>St.</abbr> Albans, and Colonel Giles Rawlins,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1504" id="noteref-1504" epub:type="noteref">1504</a> the latter of whom is killed, and the first mortally wounded, as it is thought. They fought against Captain Thomas Howard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1505" id="noteref-1505" epub:type="noteref">1505</a> my Lord Carlisle’s brother, and another unknown;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1506" id="noteref-1506" epub:type="noteref">1506</a> who, they say, had armour on that they could not be hurt, so that one of their swords went up to the hilt against it. They had horses ready, and are fled. But what is most strange, Howard sent one challenge, but they could not meet, and then another,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1507" id="noteref-1507" epub:type="noteref">1507</a> and did meet yesterday at the old Pall Mall<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1508" id="noteref-1508" epub:type="noteref">1508</a> at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and would not to the last tell Jermyn what the quarrel was; nor do anybody know. The Court is much concerned in this fray, and I am glad of it; hoping that it will cause some good laws against it. After sitting, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret and I walked a good while in the garden, who told me that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten had made his complaint to him that some of us had a mind to do him a bad turn, but I do not see that Sir George is concerned for him at all, but rather against him. He professes all love to me, and did tell me how he had spoke of me to my Lord Chancellor, and that if my Lord Sandwich would ask my Lord Chancellor, he should know what he had said of me to him to my advantage, of which I am very glad, and do not doubt that all things will grow better and better every day for me. Dined at home alone, then to my office, and there till late at night doing business, and so home, eat a bit, and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-8-30" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-08-30">20th</time>. Up early, and to my office, and thence to my Lord Sandwich, whom I found in bed, and he sent for me in. Among other talk, he do tell me that he hath put me into commission with a great many great persons in the business of Tangier, which is a very great honour to me, and may be of good concernment to me. By and by comes in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry to us, whom my Lord tells that he is also put into the commission, and that I am there, of which he said he was glad; and did tell my Lord that I was indeed the life of this office, and much more to my commendation beyond measure. And that, whereas before he did bear me respect for his sake, he do do it now much more for my own; which is a great blessing to me. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret having told me what he did yesterday concerning his speaking to my Lord Chancellor about me. So that on all hands, by God’s blessing, I find myself a very rising man. By and by comes my Lord Peterborough in, with whom we talked a good while, and he is going tomorrow towards Tangier again. I perceive there is yet good hopes of peace with Guyland<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1509" id="noteref-1509" epub:type="noteref">1509</a> which is of great concernment to Tangier. And many other things I heard which yet I understand not, and so cannot remember. My Lord and Lord Peterborough going out to the Solicitor General<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1510" id="noteref-1510" epub:type="noteref">1510</a> about the drawing up of this Commission, I went to Westminster Hall with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, and there meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townsend, he would needs take me to Fleet Street, to one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barwell, squire sadler to the King, and there we and several other Wardrobe-men dined. We had a venison pasty, and other good plain and handsome dishes; the mistress of the house a pretty, well-carriaged woman, and a fine hand she hath; and her maid a pretty brown lass. But I do find my nature ready to run back to my old course of drinking wine and staying from my business, and yet, thank God, I was not fully contented with it, but did stay at little ease, and after dinner hastened home by water, and so to my office till late at night. In the evening <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hayward came to me to advise with me about the business of the Chest, which I have now a mind to put in practice, though I know it will vex Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, which is one of the ends (God forgive me) that I have in it. So home, and eat a bit, and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-08-31">21st</time>. Up early, and to my office, and by and by we sat all the morning. At noon, though I was invited to my uncle Fenner’s to dinner to a haunch of venison I sent him yesterday, yet I did not go, but chose to go to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson’s, where my uncle Wight and my aunt, and some neighbour couples were at a very good venison pasty. Hither came, after we were set down, a most pretty young lady (only her hands were not white nor handsome), which pleased me well, and I found her to be sister to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Anne Wight that comes to my uncle Wight’s. We were good company, and had a very pretty dinner. And after dinner some talk, I with my aunt and this young lady about their being [at] Epsom, from whence they came today, and so home and to my office, and there doing business till past 9 at night, and so home and to bed. But though I drank no wine today, yet how easily was I of my own accord stirred up to desire my aunt and this pretty lady (for it was for her that I did it) to carry them to Greenwich and see the pleasure boats. But my aunt would not go, of which since I am much glad.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-9-1" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-09-01">22nd</time>. About three o’clock this morning I waked with the noise of the rayne, having never in my life heard a more violent shower; and then the catt was lockt in the chamber, and kept a great mewing, and leapt upon the bed, which made me I could not sleep a great while. Then to sleep, and about five o’clock rose, and up to my office, and about 8 o’clock went down to Deptford, and there with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Davis did look over most of his stores; by the same token in the great storehouse, while Captain Badily was talking to us, one from a trap-door above let fall unawares a coyle of cable, that it was 10,000 to one it had not broke Captain Badily’s neck, it came so near him, but did him no hurt. I went on with looking and informing myself of the stores with great delight, and having done there, I took boat home again and dined, and after dinner sent for some of my workmen and did scold at them so as I hope my work will be hastened. Then by water to Westminster Hall, and there I hear that old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hales<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1511" id="noteref-1511" epub:type="noteref">1511</a> did lately die suddenly in an hour’s time. Here I met with Will Bowyer, and had a promise from him of a place to stand tomorrow at his house to see the show. Thence to my Lord’s, and thither sent for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, who came, and walked together talking about business, and then to his lodgings at Clerke’s, the confectioner’s, where he did give me a little banquet, and I had liked to have begged a parrot for my wife, but he hath put me in a way to get a better from Steventon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1512" id="noteref-1512" epub:type="noteref">1512</a> at Portsmouth. But I did get of him a draught of Tangier to take a copy by, which pleases me very well. So home by water and to my office, where late, and so home to bed.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1662-9-2" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-09-02">23rd</time>. Up early, and about my works in my house, to see what is done and design more. Then to my office, and by and by we sat till noon at the office. After sitting, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and I did walk together a great while in the Garden, where he did tell me his mind about Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s having so much the command of the money, which must be removed. And indeed it is the bane of all our business. He observed to me also how Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten begins to struggle and to look after his business, which he do indeed a little, but it will come to nothing. I also put him upon getting an order from the Duke for our inquiries into the Chest, which he will see done. So we parted, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed by appointment being come, he and I went out together, and at an ordinary in Lombard Street dined together, and so walked down to the Styllyard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1513" id="noteref-1513" epub:type="noteref">1513</a> and so all along Thames-street, but could not get a boat: I offered eight shillings for a boat to attend me this afternoon, and they would not, it being the day of the Queen’s coming to town from Hampton Court. So we fairly walked it to Whitehall, and through my Lord’s lodgings we got into Whitehall Garden, and so to the Bowling-green, and up to the top of the new Banqueting House there, over the Thames, which was a most pleasant place as any I could have got; and all the show consisted chiefly in the number of boats and barges; and two pageants, one of a King, and another of a Queen, with her Maids of Honour sitting at her feet very prettily; and they tell me the Queen is Sir Richard Ford’s daughter. Anon come the King and Queen in a barge under a canopy with 10,000 barges and boats, I think, for we could see no water for them, nor discern the King nor Queen. And so they landed at Whitehall Bridge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1514" id="noteref-1514" epub:type="noteref">1514</a> and the great guns on the other side went off: But that which pleased me best was, that my Lady Castlemaine stood over against us upon a piece of Whitehall, where I glutted myself with looking on her. But methought it was strange to see her Lord and her upon the same place walking up and down without taking notice one of another, only at first entry he put off his hat, and she made him a very civil salute, but afterwards took no notice one of another; but both of them now and then would take their child, which the nurse held in her armes, and dandle it. One thing more; there happened a scaffold below to fall, and we feared some hurt, but there was none, but she of all the great ladies only run down among the common rabble to see what hurt was done, and did take care of a child that received some little hurt, which methought was so noble. Anon there came one there booted and spurred that she talked long with. And by and by, she being in her hair, she put on his hat, which was but an ordinary one, to keep the wind off. But methinks it became her mightily, as everything else do. The show being over, I went away, not weary with looking on her, and to my Lord’s lodgings, where my brother Tom and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Thomas Pepys were to speak with me. So I walked with them in the garden, and was very angry with them both for their going out of town without my knowledge; but they told me the business, which was to see a gentlewoman for a wife for Tom, of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cooke’s providing, worth £500, of good education, her name Hobell, and lives near Banbury, demands £40 per annum jointure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1515" id="noteref-1515" epub:type="noteref">1515</a> Tom likes her, and, they say, had a very good reception, and that Cooke hath been very serviceable therein, and that she is committed to old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Young, of the Wardrobe’s, tuition. After I had told them my mind about their folly in going so unadvisedly, I then begun to inquire after the business, and so did give no answer as to my opinion till I have looked farther into it by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Young. By and by, as we were walking in my Lord’s walk, comes my Lord, and so we broke our discourse and went in with him, and after I had put them away I went in to my Lord, and he and I had half an hour’s private discourse about the discontents of the times, which we concluded would not come to anything of difference, though the Presbyters would be glad enough of it; but we do not think religion will so soon cause another war. Then to his own business. He asked my advice there, whether he should go on to purchase more land and to borrow money to pay for it, which he is willing to do, because such a bargain as that of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Buggins’s, of Stukely, will not be every day to be had, and Brampton is now perfectly granted him by the King⁠—I mean the reversion of it⁠—after the Queen’s death; and, in the meantime, he buys it of Sir Peter Ball his present right. Then we fell to talk of Navy business, and he concludes, as I do, that he needs not put himself upon any more voyages abroad to spend money, unless a war comes; and that by keeping his family awhile in the country, he shall be able to gather money. He is glad of a friendship with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and I put him upon increasing it, which he will do, but he (as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry do) do much cry against the course of our payments and the Treasurer to have the whole power in his own hands of doing what he will, but I think will not meddle in himself. He told me also that in the Commission for Tangier <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry had advised him that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy, who intended to be Treasurer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1516" id="noteref-1516" epub:type="noteref">1516</a> and it is intended him, may not be of the Commission itself, and my Lord I think will endeavour to get him to be contented to be left out of the Commission, and it is a very good rule indeed that the Treasurer in no office ought to be of the Commission. Here we broke off, and I bid him good night, and so with much ado, the streets being at nine o’clock at night crammed with people going home to the city, for all the borders of the river had been full of people, as the King had come, to a miracle got to the Palace Yard, and there took boat, and so to the Old Swan, and so walked home, and to bed very weary.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-9-3" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-09-03">24th (Lord’s day)</time>. Slept till 7 o’clock, which I have not done a very great while, but it was my weariness last night that caused it. So rose and to my office till church time, writing down my yesterday’s observations, and so to church, where I all alone, and found Will Griffin and Thomas Hewett got into the pew next to our backs, where our maids sit, but when I come, they went out; so forward some people are to outrun themselves. Here we had a lazy, dull sermon. So home to dinner, where my brother Tom came to me, and both before and after dinner he and I walked all alone in the garden, talking about his late journey and his mistress, and for what he tells me it is like to do well. He being gone, I to church again, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills, making a sermon upon confession, he did endeavour to pull down auricular confession, but did set it up by his bad arguments against it, and advising people to come to him to confess their sins when they had any weight upon their consciences, as much as is possible, which did vex me to hear. So home, and after an hour’s being in my office alone, looking over the plates and globes, I walked to my uncle Wight’s, the truth is, in hopes to have seen and been acquainted with the pretty lady that came along with them to dinner the other day to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson, but she is gone away. But here I stayed supper, and much company there was; among others, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burnett,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1517" id="noteref-1517" epub:type="noteref">1517</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole the lawyer, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sutton, a brother of my aunt’s, that I never saw before. Among other things they tell me that there hath been a disturbance in a church in Friday Street;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1518" id="noteref-1518" epub:type="noteref">1518</a> a great many young people knotting together and crying out “Porridge”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1519" id="noteref-1519" epub:type="noteref">1519</a> often and seditiously in the church, and took the Common Prayer Book, they say, away; and, some say, did tear it; but it is a thing which appears to me very ominous. I pray God avert it. After supper home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-9-4" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-09-04">25th</time>. Up early, and among my workmen when they came, and set them in good order at work on all hands, which, though it at first began angrily, yet I pleased myself afterwards in seeing it put into a good posture, and so I left them, and away by water to Woolwich (calling in my way in Hamcreek, where I have never been before, and there found two of the King’s ships lie there without any living creature aboard, which troubled me, everything being stole away that can be), where I stayed seeing a cable of 14 inches laid, in which there was good variety. Then to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer’s, and there eat a bit of roast meat off of the spit, and so away to the yard, and there among other things mustered the yard, and did things that I perceive people do begin to value me, and that I shall be able to be of command in all matters, which God be praised for. Then to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pett’s, and there eat some fruit and drank, and so to boat again, and to Deptford, calling there about the business of my house only, and so home, where by appointment I found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waith met at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, and thither I met, and so agreed upon a way of answering my Lord Treasurer’s letter. Here I found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry had got a letter from the Duke, sent us for looking into the business of the Chest, of which I am glad. After we had done here I went home, and up among my workmen, and found they had done a good day’s work, and so to my office till late ordering of several businesses, and so home and to bed, my mind, God be praised, full of business, but great quiet.</p>

Up betimes and among my works and workmen, and with great pleasure seeing them go on merrily, and a good many hands, which I perceive makes good riddance, and so to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon dined alone with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, which I have not done a great while, but his lady being out of the way I was the willinger to do it, and after dinner he and I by water to Deptford, and there found Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret and my Lady at dinner, and so we sat down and eat another dinner of venison with them, and so we went to the payhouse, and there stayed till 10 o’clock at night paying off the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Martin</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kinsale</i>, being small but troublesome ships to pay, and so in the dark by water home to the Custom House, and so got a lantern to light us home, there being <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Morrice the wine cooper with us, he having been at Deptford to view some of the King’s casks we have to sell. So to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-09-06">27th</time>. Up and among my workmen, my work going on still very well. So to my office all the morning, and dined again with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, his Lady being in the country. Among other stories, he told us of the Mayor of Bristoll’s reading a pass with the bottom upwards; and a barber that could not read, that flung a letter in the kennel when one came to desire him to read the superscription, saying, “Do you think I stand here to read letters?” Among my workmen again, pleasing myself all the afternoon there, and so to the office doing business till past 9 at night, and so home and to bed. This afternoon <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hunt came to see me, and I did give her a Muske Millon. Today my hogshead of sherry I have sold to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and am glad of my money instead of wine. After I had wrote this at my office (as I have of late altogether done since my wife has been in the country) I went into my house, and Will having been making up books at Deptford with other clerks all day, I did not think he was come home, but was in fear for him, it being very late, what was become of him. But when I came home I found him there at his ease in his study, which vexed me cruelly, that he should no more mind me, but to let me be all alone at the office waiting for him. Whereupon I struck him, and did stay up till 12 o’clock at night chiding him for it, and did in plain terms tell him that I would not be served so, and that I am resolved to look out some boy that I may have the bringing up of after my own mind, and which I do intend to do, for I do find that he has got a taste of liberty since he came to me that he will not leave. Having discharged my mind, I went to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-09-07">28th</time>. I observe that Will, whom I used to call two or three times in a morning, would now wake of himself and rise without calling. Which though angry I was glad to see. So I rose and among my workmen, in my gown, without a doublet, an hour or two or more, till I was afraid of getting an ague, and so to the office, and there we sat all the morning, and at noon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and I dined at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, where I have now dined three days together, and so in the afternoon again we sat, which we intend to do two afternoons in a week besides our other sitting. In the evening we rose, and I to see how my work goes on, and so to my office, writing by the post and doing other matters, and so home and to bed late.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-09-08">29th</time>. Up betimes and among my workmen, where I did stay with them the greatest part of the morning, only a little at the office, and so to dinner alone at home, and so to my workmen again, finding my presence to carry on the work both to my mind and with more haste, and I thank God I am pleased with it. At night, the workmen being gone, I went to my office, and among other businesses did begin tonight with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lewes to look into the nature of a purser’s account, and the business of victualling, in which there is great variety; but I find I shall understand it, and be able to do service there also. So being weary and chill, being in some fear of an ague, I went home and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-09-09">30th</time>. Up betimes among my workmen, and so to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon rose and had news that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn would be in town from Ireland, which I much wonder at, he giving so little notice of it, and it troubled me exceedingly what to do for a lodging, and more what to do with my goods, that are all in his house; but at last I resolved to let them lie there till Monday, and so got Griffin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1520" id="noteref-1520" epub:type="noteref">1520</a> to get a lodging as near as he could, which is without a door of our back door upon Tower Hill, a chamber where John Davis, one of our clerks, do lie in, but he do provide himself elsewhere, and I am to have his chamber. So at the office all the afternoon and the evening till past 10 at night expecting Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s coming, but he not coming tonight I went thither and there lay very well, and like my lodging well enough. My man Will after he had got me to bed did go home and lay there, and my maid Jane lay among my goods at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-9-10" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-09-10">31st (Lord’s day)</time>. Waked early, but being in a strange house, did not rise till 7 o’clock almost, and so rose and read over my oaths, and whiled away an hour thinking upon businesses till Will came to get me ready, and so got ready and to my office, and thence to church. After sermon home and dined alone. News is brought me that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn is come. But I would take no notice thereof till after dinner, and then sent him word that I would wait on him, but he is gone to bed. So to my office, and there made my monthly accounts, and find myself worth in money about £686 19<abbr>s.</abbr> 2½<abbr>d.</abbr>, for which God be praised; and indeed greatly I hope to thank Almighty God, who do most manifestly bless me in my endeavours to do the duties of my office, I now saving money, and my expenses being little. My wife is still in the country; my house all in dirt; but my work in a good forwardness, and will be much to my mind at last. In the afternoon to church, and there heard a simple sermon of a stranger upon David’s words, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the way of the ungodly,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and the best of his sermon was the degrees of walking, standing, and sitting, showing how by steps and degrees sinners do grow in wickedness. After sermon to my brother Tom’s, who I found has taken physic today, and I talked with him about his country mistress, and read Cook’s letter, wherein I am well satisfied, and will appear in promoting it; so back and to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rawlinson’s, and there supped with him, and in came my uncle Wight and my aunt. Our discourse of the discontents that are abroad, among, and by reason of the Presbyters. Some were clapped up today, and strict watch is kept in the City by the train-bands, and letters of a plot are taken. God preserve us! for all these things bode very ill. So home, and after going to welcome home Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who was unready, going to bed, I stayed with him a little while, and so to my lodging and to bed.</p>
