				<p><time datetime="1666-10-11">October 1st, 1666</time>. Up, and all the morning at the office, getting the list of all the ships and vessels employed since the war, for the Committee of Parliament. At noon with it to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s chamber, and there dined with him and [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, and after dinner examined it and find it will do us much right in the number of men rising to near the expense we delivered to the Parliament. [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry and I (the others going before the Committee) to Lord Brouncker’s for his hand, and find him simply mighty busy in a council of the Queen’s. He come out and took in the papers to sign, and sent them mighty wisely out again. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry away to the Committee, and I to the Mercer’s, and there took a bill of what I owe of late, which comes to about £17. Thence to Whitehall, and there did hear Betty Michell was at this end of the town, and so without breach of vowe did stay to endeavour to meet with her and carry her home; but she did not come, so I lost my whole afternoon. But pretty! how I took another pretty woman for her, taking her a clap on the breech, thinking verily it had been her. Stayed till [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn come out, and so away home by water with them, and to the office to do some business, and then home, and my wife do tell me that <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer tells her that Mercer hath no mind to come. So I was angry at it, and resolved with her to have Falconbridge’s girle, and I think it will be better for us, and will please me better with singing. With this resolution, to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-12">2nd</time>. Up, and am sent for to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, and to him, and there he tells me how our lists are referred to a Subcommittee to consider and examine, and that I am ordered to be there this afternoon. So I away thence to my new bookbinder to see my books gilding in the backs, and then to Whitehall to the House, and spoke to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, where he told me I must attend the Committee in the afternoon, and received some hints of more work to do. So I away to the ’Chequer, and thence to an alehouse, and found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconbridge, and agreed for his kinswoman to come to me. He says she can dress my wife, and will do anything we would have her to do, and is of a good spirit and mighty cheerful. He is much pleased therewith, and so we shall be. So agreed for her coming the next week. So away home, and eat a short dinner, and then with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn to Whitehall, and do give his boy my book of papers to hold while he went into the Committee Chamber in the Inner Court of Wards,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2993" id="noteref-2993" epub:type="noteref">2993</a> and I walked without with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Slingsby, of the Tower, who was there, and who did in walking inform me mightily in several things; among others, that the heightening or lowering of money is only a cheat, and do good to some particular men, which, if I can but remember how, I am now by him fully convinced of. Anon Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn went away, telling me that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry that was within had told him that the fleet is all come into the buoy of the Nore, and that he must hasten down to them, and so went away, and I into the Committee Chamber before the Committee sat, and there heard Birch discourse highly and understandingly about the Navy business and a proposal made heretofore to farm the Navy; but Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry did abundantly answer him, and is a most excellent person. By and by the Committee met, and I walked out, and anon they rose and called me in, and appointed me to attend a Committee of them tomorrow at the office to examine our lists. This put me into a mighty fear and trouble; they doing it in a very ill humour, methought. So I away and called on my Lord Brouncker to desire him to be there tomorrow, and so home, having taken up my wife at Unthanke’s, full of trouble in mind to think what I shall be obliged to answer, that am neither fully fit, nor in any measure concerned to take the shame and trouble of this office upon me, but only from the inability and folly of the Comptroller that occasions it. When come home I to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s, to his boy, for my book, and there find he hath it not, but delivered it to the doorkeeper of the Committee for me. This, added to my former disquiet, made me stark mad, considering all the nakedness of the office lay open in papers within those covers. I could not tell in the world what to do, but was mad on all sides, and that which made me worse Captain Cocke was there, and he did so swear and curse at the boy that told me. So Cocke, Griffin, and the boy with me, they to find the housekeeper of the Parliament, Hughes, while I to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, but could hear nothing of it there. But coming to our rendezvous at the Swan Tavern, in King Street, I find they have found the housekeeper, and the book simply locked up in the Court. So I stayed and drank, and rewarded the doorkeeper, and away home, my heart lighter by all this, but to bed very sad notwithstanding, in fear of what will happen tomorrow upon their coming.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-13">3rd</time>. Waked betimes, mightily troubled in mind, and in the most true trouble that I ever was in my life, saving in the business last year of the East India prizes. So up, and with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer and Griffin to consider of our business, and books and papers necessary for this examination; and by and by, by eight o’clock, comes Birch, the first, with the lists and books of accounts delivered in. He calls me to work, and there he and I begun, when, by and by, comes Garraway,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2994" id="noteref-2994" epub:type="noteref">2994</a> the first time I ever saw him, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Thompson and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Boscawen. They to it, and I did make shift to answer them better than I expected. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, Lord Brouncker, [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, come in, but presently went out; and [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes come in, and said two or three words from the purpose, but to do hurt; and so away he went also, and left me all the morning with them alone to stand or fall. At noon Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten comes to them to invite them (though fast day) to dinner, which they did, and good company they were, but especially Garraway. Here I have news brought me of my father’s coming to town, and I presently to him, glad to see him, poor man, he being come to town unexpectedly to see us and the city. I could not stay with him, but after dinner to work again, only the Committee and I, till dark night, and by that time they cast up all the lists, and found out what the medium of men was borne all the war, of all sorts, and ended with good peace, and much seeming satisfaction; but I find them wise and reserved, and instructed to hit all our blots, as among others, that we reckon the ships full manned from the beginning. They gone, and my heart eased of a great deal of fear and pain, and reckoning myself to come off with victory, because not overcome in anything or much foiled, I away to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s chamber, but he not within, then to Whitehall, and there among the ladies, and saw my Lady Castlemaine never looked so ill, nor <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stewart neither, as in this plain, natural dress. I was not pleased with either of them. Away, not finding [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, and so home, and there find my father and my brother come to town⁠—my father without my expectation; but glad I am to see him. And so to supper with him, and to work again at the office; then home, to set up all my folio books, which are come home gilt on the backs, very handsome to the eye, and then at midnight to bed. This night [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn told me [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten swears he will have nothing to do with the Privateer if his son do not go Lieutenant, which angers me and him; but we will be even with him, one way or other.</p>

			<article id="entry-1666-10-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1666-10-14">4th</time>. Up, and mighty betimes, to [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, to give him an account of yesterday’s work, which do give him good content. He did then tell me his speech lately to the House in his own vindication about the report of his selling of places, he having a small occasion offered him by chance, which he did desire, and took, and did it to his content, and, he says, to the House’s seeming to approve of it by their hum. He confessed how long he had done it, and how he desired to have something else; and, since then, he had taken nothing, and challenged all the world. I was glad of this also. Thence up to the Duke of York, by appointment, with fellow officers, to complaine, but to no purpose, of want of money, and so away. I to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, to his lodging, and here discoursed much of the want of money and our being designed for destruction. How the King hath lost his power, by submitting himself to this way of examining his accounts, and is become but as a private man. He says the King is troubled at it, but they talk an entry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2995" id="noteref-2995" epub:type="noteref">2995</a> shall be made, that it is not to be brought into example; that the King must, if they do not agree presently, make them a courageous speech, which he says he may do, the City of London being now burned, and himself master of an army, better than any prince before him, and so I believe. Thence home, about noon, to dinner. After dinner the book binder come, and I sent by him some more books to gild. I to the office all day, and spent most of it with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Warren, whom I have had no discourse with a great while, and when all is done I do find him a mighty wise man as any I know, and his counsel as much to be followed. Late with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater upon comparing the charge and husbandry of the last Dutch war with ours now, and do find good roome to think we have done little worse than they, whereof good use may and will be made. So home to supper, and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1666-10-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1666-10-15">5th</time>. Up, and with my father talking awhile, then to the office, and there troubled with a message from Lord Peterborough about money; but I did give as kind answer as I could, though I hate him. Then to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret to discourse about paying of part of the great ships come in, and so home again to compare the comparison of the two Dutch wars’ charges for [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, and then by water (and saw old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Michell digging like a painfull father for his son) to him, and find him at dinner. After dinner to look over my papers, and comparing them with some notes of his and brought me, the sight of some good Navy notes of his which I shall get. Then examined and liked well my notes, and away together to Whitehall, in the way discoursing the inconvenience of the King’s being thus subject to an account, but it will be remedied for the time to come, he thinks, if we can get this over, and I find he will have the Comptroller’s business better done, swearing he will never be for a wit to be employed on business again. Thence I home, and back again to Whitehall, and meeting Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly to Whitehall; there walked till night that the Committee come down, and there Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry tells me that the Subcommittee have made their report to the Grand Committee, and in pretty kind terms, and have agreed upon allowing us £4 per head, which I am sure will do the business, but he had endeavoured to have got more, but this do well, and he and I are both mighty glad it is come to this, and the heat of the present business seems almost over. But I have more worke cut out for me, to prepare a list of the extraordinaries, not to be included within the £4, against Monday. So I away from him, and met with the Vice-Chamberlain, and I told him when I had this evening in coming hither met with Captain Cocke, and he told me of a wild motion made in the House of Lords by the Duke of Buckingham for all men that had cheated the King to be declared traitors and felons, and that my Lord Sandwich was named. This put me into a great pain, so the Vice-Chamberlain, who had heard nothing of it, having been all day in the City, away with me to Whitehall; and there come to me and told me that, upon Lord Ashly’s asking their direction whether, being a peere, he should bring in his accounts to the Commons, which they did give way to, the Duke of Buckingham did move that, for the time to come, what I have written above might be declared by some fuller law than heretofore. Lord Ashly answered, that it was not the fault of the present laws, but want of proof; and so said the Lord Chancellor. He answered, that a better law, he thought, might be made so the House laughing, did refer it to him to bring in a Bill to that purpose, and this was all. So I away with joyful heart home, calling on Cocke and telling him the same. So I away home to the office to clear my Journall for five days, and so home to supper and to bed, my father who had stayed out late and troubled me thereat being come home well and gone to bed, which pleases me also. This day, coming home, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirton’s kinsman, my bookseller, come in my way; and so I am told by him that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirton is utterly undone, and made 2 or £3,000 worse than nothing, from being worth 7 or £8,000. That the goods laid in the Churchyarde fired through the windows those in <abbr>St.</abbr> Fayth’s church; and those coming to the warehouses’ doors fired them, and burned all the books and the pillars of the church, so as the roof falling down, broke quite down, which it did not do in the other places of the church, which is alike pillared (which I knew not before); but being not burned, they stand still. He do believe there is above £50,000 of books burned; all the great booksellers almost undone: not only these, but their warehouses at their Hall, and under Christchurch, and elsewhere being all burned. A great want thereof there will be of books, specially Latin books and foreign books; and, among others, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Polyglottes</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2996" id="noteref-2996" epub:type="noteref">2996</a> and new Bible, which he believes will be presently worth £40 apiece.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-16">6th</time>. Up, and having seen my brother in his cassocke, which I am not the most satisfied in, being doubtful at this time what course to have him profess too soon. To the office and there busy about a list of the extraordinaries of the charge of the fleet this war; and was led to go to the office of the ordnance to be satisfied in something, and find their accounts and books kept in mighty good order, but that they can give no light, nor will the nature of their affairs permit it to tell what the charge of the ordnance comes to a man a month. So home again and to dinner, there coming Creed to me; but what with business and my hatred to the man, I did not spend any time with him, but after dinner [my] wife and he and I took coach and to Westminster, but he ’light about Paul’s, and set her at her tailor’s, and myself to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, but there missing [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, returned and took up my wife, and calling at the Exchange home, whither Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly come to visit me, but my business suffered me not to stay with him. So he gone I by water to Westminster Hall and thence to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and there found [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry waiting for me, and I did give him a good account to his mind of the business he expected about extraordinaries and then fell to other talk, among others, our sad condition contracted by want of a Comptroller;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2997" id="noteref-2997" epub:type="noteref">2997</a> and it was his words, that he believes, besides all the shame and trouble he hath brought on the office, the King had better have given £100,000 than ever have had him there. He did discourse about some of these discontented Parliament-men, and says that Birch is a false rogue, but that Garraway is a man that hath not been well used by the Court, though very stout to death, and hath suffered all that is possible for the King from the beginning. But discontented as he is, yet he never knew a Session of Parliament but he hath done some good deed for the King before it rose. I told him the passage Cocke told me of his having begged a brace of bucks of the Lord Arlington for him, and when it come to him, he sent it back again. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry told me, it is much to be pitied that the King should lose the service of a man so able and faithful; and that he ought to be brought over, but that it is always observed, that by bringing over one discontented man, you raise up three in his room; which is a State lesson I never knew before. But when others discover your fear, and that discontent procures favour, they will be discontented too, and impose on you. Thence to Whitehall and got a coach and home, and there did business late, and so home and set up my little books of one of my presses come home gilt, which pleases me mightily, and then to bed. This morning my wife told me of a fine gentlewoman my Lady Penn tells her of, for £20 per annum, that sings, dances, plays on four or five instruments and many other fine things, which pleases me mightily: and she sent to have her see her, which she did this afternoon; but sings basely, and is a tawdry wench that would take £8, but [neither] my wife nor I think her fit to come.</p>

			<article id="entry-1666-10-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1666-10-17">7th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up, and after visiting my father in his chamber, to church, and then home to dinner. Little Michell and his wife come to dine with us, which they did, and then presently after dinner I with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes to Whitehall, where met by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and Lord Brouncker, to attend the King and Duke of York at the Cabinet; but nobody had determined what to speak of, but only in general to ask for money. So I was forced immediately to prepare in my mind a method of discoursing. And anon we were called in to the Green Room, where the King, Duke of York, Prince Rupert, Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, Duke of Albemarle, [Sirs] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, Morrice. Nobody beginning, I did, and made a current, and I thought a good speech, laying open the ill state of the Navy: by the greatness of the debt; greatness of work to do against next yeare; the time and materials it would take; and our incapacity, through a total want of money. I had no sooner done, but Prince Rupert rose up and told the King in a heat, that whatever the gentleman had said, he had brought home his fleet in as good a condition as ever any fleet was brought home; that twenty boats would be as many as the fleet would want: and all the anchors and cables left in the storm might be taken up again. This arose from my saying, among other things we had to do, that the fleet was come in⁠—the greatest fleet that ever his Majesty had yet together, and that in as bad condition as the enemy or weather could put it; and to use Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s words, who is upon the place taking a survey, he dreads the reports he is to receive from the Surveyors of its defects.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2998" id="noteref-2998" epub:type="noteref">2998</a> I therefore did only answer, that I was sorry for his Highness’s offence, but that what I said was but the report we received from those entrusted in the fleet to inform us. He muttered and repeated what he had said; and so, after a long silence on all hands, nobody, not so much as the Duke of Albemarle, seconding the Prince, nor taking notice of what he said, we withdrew. I was not a little troubled at this passage, and the more when speaking with Jacke Fenn about it, he told me that the Prince will be asking now who this Pepys is, and find him to be a creature of my Lord Sandwich’s, and therefore this was done only to disparage him. Anon they broke, up, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry come out; so I asked his advice. He told me he had said something to salve it, which was, that his Highness had, he believed, rightly informed the King that the fleet is come in good condition to have stayed out yet longer, and have fought the enemy, but yet that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys his meaning might be, that, though in so good condition, if they should come in and lie all the winter, we shall be very loth to send them to sea for another year’s service with[out] great repairs. He said it would be no hurt if I went to him, and showed him the report himself brought up from the fleet, where every ship, by the Commander’s report, do need more or less, and not to mention more of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn for doing him a mischief. So I said I would, but do not think that all this will redound to my hurt, because the truth of what I said will soon appear. Thence, having been informed that, after all this pains, the King hath found out how to supply us with 5 or £6,000, when £100,000 were at this time but absolutely necessary, and we mentioned £50,000. This is every day a greater and greater omen of ruin. God fit us for it! Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes and I home (it raining) by coach, calling only on Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret at his lodging (who is I find troubled at my Lord Treasurer and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Ph.</abbr> Warwicke bungling in his accounts), and come home to supper with my father, and then all to bed. I made my brother in his cassocke to say grace this day, but I like his voice so ill that I begin to be sorry he hath taken this order upon him.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-18">8th</time>. Up and to my office, called up by Commissioner Middleton,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2999" id="noteref-2999" epub:type="noteref">2999</a> newly come to town, but stayed not with me; so I to my office busy all the morning. Towards noon, by water to Westminster Hall, and there by several hear that the Parliament do resolve to do something to retrench Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s great salary; but cannot hear of anything bad they can lay to his charge. The House did this day order to be engrossed the Bill against importing Irish cattle; a thing, it seems, carried on by the Western Parliament-men, wholly against the sense of most of the rest of the House; who think if you do this, you give the Irish again cause to rebel. Thus plenty on both sides makes us mad. The Committee of the Canary Company of both factions come to me for my Cousin Roger that is of the Committee.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3000" id="noteref-3000" epub:type="noteref">3000</a> Thence with [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry when the House rose and [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and there agreed of and signed our paper of extraordinaries, and there left them, and I to Unthanke’s, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconbridge’s girle is, and by and by comes my wife, who likes her well, though I confess I cannot (though she be of my finding out and sings pretty well), because she will be raised from so mean a condition to so high all of a sudden; but she will be much to our profit, more than Mercer, less expense. Here we bespoke a new gown for her, and to come to us on Friday. She being gone, my wife and I home by coach, and then I presently by water with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce to Westminster Hall, he in the way telling me how the Duke of York and Duke of Albemarle do not agree. The Duke of York is wholly given up to this bitch of Denham. The Duke of Albemarle and Prince Rupert do less agree. So that we are all in pieces, and nobody knows what will be done the next year. The King hath yesterday in Council declared his resolution of setting a fashion for clothes, which he will never alter.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3001" id="noteref-3001" epub:type="noteref">3001</a> It will be a vest, I know not well how; but it is to teach the nobility thrift, and will do good. By and by comes down from the Committee [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, and I find him troubled at several things happened this afternoon, which vexes me also; our business looking worse and worse, and our worke growing on our hands. Time spending, and no money to set anything in hand with; the end thereof must be speedy ruin. The Dutch insult and have taken off Bruant’s head,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3002" id="noteref-3002" epub:type="noteref">3002</a> which they have not dared to do (though found guilty of the fault he did die for, of something of the Prince of Orange’s faction) till just now, which speaks more confidence in our being worse than before. Alderman Maynell, I hear, is dead. Thence returned in the dark by coach all alone, full of thoughts of the consequences of this ill complexion of affairs, and how to save myself and the little I have, which if I can do, I have cause to bless God that I am so well, and shall be well contented to retreat to Brampton, and spend the rest of my days there. So to my office, and did some business, and finished my Journall with resolutions, if God bless me, to apply myself soberly to settle all matters for myself, and expect the event of all with comfort. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-19">9th</time>. Up and to the office, where we sat the first day since the fire, I think. At noon home, and my uncle Thomas was there, and dined with my brother and I (my father and I were gone abroad), and then to the office again in the afternoon, and there close all day long, and did much business. At night to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, where Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford did occasion some discourse of sending a convoy to the Maderas; and this did put us upon some new thoughts of sending our privateer thither on merchants’ accounts, which I have more mind to, the profit being certain and occasion honest withall. So home, and to supper with my father, and then to set my remainder of my books gilt in order with much pleasure, and so late to bed.</p>

Thence with him to Westminster, to the parish church,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3004" id="noteref-3004" epub:type="noteref">3004</a> where the Parliament-men, and Stillingfleete in the pulpit.

				<p>He and I did bemoan our public condition. He tells me the Duke of Albemarle is under a cloud, and they have a mind at Court to lay him aside. This I know not; but all things are not right with him, and I am glad of it, but sorry for the time. So home to supper, and to bed, it being my wedding night,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3006" id="noteref-3006" epub:type="noteref">3006</a> but how many years I cannot tell; but my wife says ten.</p>

I did give him money, poor man, and he overjoyed. So left him, and to the office, where nothing but sad evidences of ruin coming on us for want of money. So home to dinner, which was a very good dinner, my father, brother, wife and I, and then to the office again, where I was all the afternoon till very late, busy, and then home to supper and to bed.</p>
				<p><em>Memorandum.</em> I had taken my Journall during the fire and the disorders following in loose papers until this very day, and could not get time to enter them in my book till January 18, in the morning, having made my eyes sore by frequent attempts this winter to do it. But now it is done, for which I thank God, and pray never the like occasion may happen.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-22">12th</time>. Up, and after taking leave of my poor father, who is setting out this day for Brampton by the Cambridge coach, he having taken a journey to see the city burned, and to bring my brother to town, I out by water; and so coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, the weather being foul; and there, from Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, do hear how the House have cut us off £150,000 of our wear and tear, for that which was saved by the King while the fleet lay in harbour in winter. However, he seems pleased, and so am I, that they have abated no more, and do intend to allow of 28,000 men for the next year; and this day have appointed to declare the sum they will give the King,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3007" id="noteref-3007" epub:type="noteref">3007</a> and to propose the way of raising it; so that this is likely to be the great day. This done in his chamber, I with him to Westminster Hall, and there took a few turns, the Hall mighty full of people, and the House likely to be very full today about the money business. Here I met with several people, and do find that people have a mighty mind to have a fling at the Vice-Chamberlain, if they could lay hold of anything, his place being, indeed, too much for such, they think, or any single subject of no greater parts and quality than he, to enjoy. But I hope he may weather all, though it will not be by any dexterity of his, I dare say, if he do stand, but by his fate only, and people’s being taken off by other things. Thence home by coach, mighty dirty weather, and then to the Treasurer’s office and got a ticket paid for my little Michell, and so again by coach to Westminster, and come presently after the House rose. So to the Swan, and there sent for a piece of meat and dined alone and played with Sarah, and so to the Hall a while, and thence to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s lodging and did what I would with her. She is very big, and resolves I must be godfather. Thence away by water with Cropp to Deptford. It was almost night before I got thither. So I did only give directions concerning a press that I have making there to hold my turning and joiner’s tooles that were lately given me, which will be very handsome, and so away back again, it being now dark, and so home, and there find my wife come home, and hath brought her new girle I have helped her to, of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconbridge’s. She is wretched poor; and but ordinary favoured; and we fain to lay out seven or eight pounds worth of clothes upon her back, which, methinks, do go against my heart; and I do not think I can ever esteem her as I could have done another that had come fine and handsome; and which is more, her voice, for want of use, is so furred, that it do not at present please me; but her manner of singing is such, that I shall, I think, take great pleasure in it. Well, she is come, and I wish us good fortune in her. Here I met with notice of a meeting of the Commissioners for Tangier tomorrow, and so I must have my accounts ready for them, which caused me to confine myself to my chamber presently and set to the making up my accounts, which I find very clear, but with much difficulty by reason of my not doing them sooner, things being out of my mind.</p>

			<article id="entry-1666-10-23" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1666-10-23">13th</time>. It cost me till four o’clock in the morning, and, which was pretty to think, I was above an hour, after I had made all right, in casting up of about twenty sums, being dozed with much work, and had for forty times together forgot to carry the 60 which I had in my mind, in one denomination which exceeded 60; and this did confound me for above an hour together. At last all even and done, and so to bed. Up at seven, and so to the office, after looking over my last night’s work. We sat all the morning. At noon by coach with my Lord Brouncker and ’light at the Temple, and so alone I to dinner at a cook’s, and thence to my Lord Bellasses, whom I find kind; but he had drawn some new proposal to deliver to the Lords Commissioners today, wherein one was, that the garrison would not be well paid without some goldsmith’s undertaking the paying of the bills of exchange for Tallies. He professing so much kindness to me, and saying that he would not be concerned in the garrison without me; and that if he continued in the employment, no man should have to do with the money but myself. I did ask his Lordship’s meaning of the proposition in his paper. He told me he had not much considered it, but that he meant no harm to me. I told him I thought it would render me useless; whereupon he did very frankly, after my seeming denials for a good while, cause it to be writ over again, and that clause left out, which did satisfy me abundantly. It being done, he and I together to Whitehall, and there the Duke of York (who is gone over to all his pleasures again, and leaves off care of business, what with his woman, my Lady Denham, and his hunting three times a week) was just come in from hunting. So I stood and saw him dress himself, and try on his vest, which is the King’s new fashion, and will be in it for good and all on Monday next, and the whole Court: it is a fashion, the King says; he will never change. He being ready, he and my Lord Chancellor, and Duke of Albemarle, and Prince Rupert, Lord Bellasses, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly, Povy, and myself, met at a Committee for Tangier. My Lord Bellasses’s propositions were read and discoursed of, about reducing the garrison to less charge; and indeed I am mad in love with my Lord Chancellor, for he do comprehend and speak out well, and with the greatest easiness and authority that ever I saw man in my life. I did never observe how much easier a man do speak when he knows all the company to be below him, than in him; for though he spoke, indeed, excellent well, yet his manner and freedom of doing it, as if he played with it, and was informing only all the rest of the company, was mighty pretty. He did call again and again upon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy for his accounts. I did think fit to make the solemn tender of my accounts that I intended. I said something that was liked, touching the want of money, and the bad credit of our tallies. My Lord Chancellor moved, that without any trouble to any of the rest of the Lords, I might alone attend the King, when he was with his private Council; and open the state of the garrison’s want of credit; and all that could be done, should. Most things moved were referred to Committees, and so we broke up. And at the end Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry come; so I away with him, and he discoursed with me something of the Parliament’s business. They have voted giving the [King] for next year £1,800,000; which, were it not for his debts, were a great sum. He says, he thinks the House may say no more to us for the present, but that we must mend our manners against the next tryall, and mend them we will. But he thinks it not a fit time to be found making of trouble among ourselves, meaning about Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, who most certainly must be removed, or made a Commissioner, and somebody else Comptroller. But he tells me that the House has a great envy at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, and that had he ever thought fit in all his discourse to have touched upon the point of our want of money and badness of payment, it would have been laid hold on to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s hurt; but he hath avoided it, though without much reason for it, most studiously, and in short did end thus, that he has never shown so much of the pigeon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3008" id="noteref-3008" epub:type="noteref">3008</a> in all his life as in his innocence to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret at this time; which I believe, and will desire Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret to thank him for it. So we broke up and I by coach home, calling for a new pair of shoes, and so, little being to do at the office, did go home, and after spending a little in righting some of my books, which stood out of order, I to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-24">14th (Lord’s day)</time>. Lay long in bed, among other things, talking of my wife’s renewing her acquaintance with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce, which, by my wife’s ill using her when she was here last, hath been interrupted. Herein we were a little angry together, but presently friends again; and so up, and I to church, which was mighty full, and my beauties, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lethulier<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3009" id="noteref-3009" epub:type="noteref">3009</a> and fair Batelier, both there. A very foul morning, and rained; and sent for my cloake to go out of the church with. So dined, and after dinner (a good discourse thereat to my brother) he and I by water to Whitehall, and he to Westminster Abbey. Here I met with Sir Stephen Fox, who told me how much right I had done myself, and how well it is represented by the Committee to the House, my readiness to give them satisfaction in everything when they were at the office. I was glad of this. He did further discourse of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s great abilities, and how necessary it were that I were of the House to assist him. I did not own it, but do myself think it were not unnecessary if either he should die, or be removed to the Lords, or anything to hinder his doing the like service the next trial, which makes me think that it were not a thing very unfit; but I will not move in it. He and I parted, I to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, thinking to have met <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Burrows, but she was not there, so away and took my brother out of the Abbey and home, and there to set some accounts right, and to the office to even my Journall, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1666-10-25" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1666-10-25">15th</time>. Called up, though a very rainy morning, by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmley, and he and I most of the morning together evening of accounts, which I was very glad of. Then he and I out to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Robt.</abbr> Viner’s, at the African house<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3010" id="noteref-3010" epub:type="noteref">3010</a> (where I had not been since he come thither); but he was not there; but I did some business with his people, and then to Colvill’s, who, I find, lives now in Lyme Street, and with the same credit as ever, this fire having not done them any wrong that I hear of at all. Thence he and I together to Westminster Hall, in our way talking of matters and passages of state, the viciousness of the Court; the contempt the King brings himself into thereby; his minding nothing, but doing all things just as his people about him will have it; the Duke of York becoming a slave to this whore Denham, and wholly minds her; that there really was amours between the Duchess and Sidney;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3011" id="noteref-3011" epub:type="noteref">3011</a> a that there is reason to fear that, as soon as the Parliament have raised this money, the King will see that he hath got all that he can get, and then make up a peace. He tells me, what I wonder at, but that I find it confirmed by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce, whom I met by-and-by in the Hall, that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry is of the caball with the Duke of York, and Brouncker, with this Denham; which is a shame, and I am sorry for it, and that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry do make her visits; but yet I hope it is not so. Pierce tells me, that as little agreement as there is between the Prince<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3012" id="noteref-3012" epub:type="noteref">3012</a> and Duke of Albemarle, yet they are likely to go to sea again; for the first will not be trusted alone, and nobody will go with him but this Duke of Albemarle. He tells me much how all the commanders of the fleet and officers that are sober men do cry out upon their bad discipline, and the ruin that must follow it if it continue. But that which I wonder most at, it seems their secretaries have been the most exorbitant in their fees to all sorts of the people, that it is not to be believed that they durst do it, so as it is believed they have got £800 apiece by the very vacancies in the fleet. He tells me that Lady Castlemayne is concluded to be with child again; and that all the people about the King do make no scruple of saying that the King do lie with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stewart, who, he says, is a most excellent-natured lady. This day the King begins to put on his vest, and I did see several persons of the House of Lords and Commons too, great courtiers, who are in it; being a long cassocke close to the body, of black cloth, and pinked with white silke under it, and a coat over it, and the legs ruffled with black riband like a pigeon’s leg; and, upon the whole, I wish the King may keep it, for it is a very fine and handsome garment.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3013" id="noteref-3013" epub:type="noteref">3013</a> Walking with Pierce in the Court of Wards out comes Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, and he and I talked of business. Among others I proposed the making Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes a Commissioner, and make somebody else Comptroller. He tells me it is the thing he hath been thinking of, and hath spoke to the Duke of York of it. He believes it will be done; but that which I fear is that Penn will be Comptroller, which I shall grudge a little. The Duke of Buckingham called him aside and spoke a good while with him. I did presently fear it might be to discourse something of his design to blemish my Lord of Sandwich, in pursuance of the wild motion he made the other day in the House. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, when he come to me again, told me that he had wrought a miracle, which was, the convincing the Duke of Buckingham that something⁠—he did not name what⁠—that he had intended to do was not fit to be done, and that the Duke is gone away of that opinion. This makes me verily believe it was something like what I feared. By and by the House rose, and then we parted, and I with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, and walked in the Exchequer Court, discoursing of businesses. Among others, I observing to him how friendly Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry had carried himself to him in these late inquiries, when, if he had borne him any spleen, he could have had what occasion he pleased offered him, he did confess he found the same thing, and would thanke him for it. I did give him some other advices, and so away with him to his lodgings at Whitehall to dinner, where my Lady Carteret is, and mighty kind, both of them, to me. Their son and my Lady Jemimah will be here very speedily. She tells me the ladies are to go into a new fashion shortly, and that is, to wear short coats, above their ankles; which she and I do not like, but conclude this long trayne to be mighty graceful. But she cries out of the vices of the Court, and how they are going to set up plays already; and how, the next day after the late great fast, the Duchess of York did give the King and Queen a play. Nay, she told me that they have heretofore had plays at Court the very nights before the fast for the death of the late King. She do much cry out upon these things, and that which she believes will undo the whole nation; and I fear so too. After dinner away home, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brisband along with me as far as the Temple, and there looked upon a new booke, set out by one Rycault,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3014" id="noteref-3014" epub:type="noteref">3014</a> secretary to my Lord Winchelsea, of the policy and customs of the Turks, which is, it seems, much cried up. But I could not stay, but home, where I find Balty come back, and with him some muster-books, which I am glad of, and hope he will do me credit in his employment. By and by took coach again and carried him home, and my wife to her tailor’s, while I to Whitehall to have found out Povy, but miss him and so call in my wife and home again, where at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s I met Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, lately come from the fleet at the Nore; and here were many good fellows, among others Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Holmes, who is exceeding kind to me, more than usual, which makes me afeard of him, though I do much wish his friendship. Thereupon, after a little stay, I withdrew, and to the office and awhile, and then home to supper and to my chamber to settle a few papers, and then to bed. This day the great debate was in Parliament, the manner of raising the £1,800,000 they voted [the King] on Friday; and at last, after many proposals, one moved that the Chimney-money might be taken from the King, and an equal revenue of something else might be found for the King, and people be enjoined to buy off this tax of Chimney-money forever at eight years’ purchase, which will raise present money, as they think, £1,600,000, and the State be eased of an ill burden and the King be supplied of something as food or better for his use. The House seems to like this, and put off the debate to tomorrow.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-26">16th</time>. Up, and to the office, where sat to do little business but hear clamours for money. At noon home to dinner, and to the office again, after hearing my brother play a little upon the Lyra viol, which he do so as to show that he hath a love to music and a spirit for it, which I am well pleased with. All the afternoon at the office, and at night with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, [and Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, at [Sir] <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s lodgings, advising about business and orders fit presently to make about discharging of ships come into the river, and which to pay first, and many things in order thereto. But it vexed me that, it being now past seven o’clock, and the businesses of great weight, and I had done them by eight o’clock, and sending them to be signed, they were all gone to bed, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, though awake, would not, being in bed, have them brought to him to sign; this made me quite angry.

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-27">17th</time>. Up, and busy about public and private business all the morning at the office. At noon home to dinner, alone with my brother, with whom I had now the first private talk I have had, and find he hath preached but twice in his life. I did give him some advice to study pronunciation; but I do fear he will never make a good speaker, nor, I fear, any general good scholar, for I do not see that he minds optickes or mathematics of any sort, nor anything else that I can find. I know not what he may be at divinity and ordinary school-learning. However, he seems sober, and that pleases me. After dinner took him and my wife and Barker (for so is our new woman called, and is yet but a sorry girle), and set them down at Unthanke’s, and so to Whitehall, and there find some of my brethren with the Duke of York, but so few I put off the meeting. So stayed and heard the Duke discourse, which he did mighty scurrilously, of the French, and with reason, that they should give Beaufort orders when he was to bring, and did bring, his fleet hither, that his rendezvous for his fleet, and for all slugs to come to, should be between Calais and Dover; which did prove the taking of La Roche[lle], who, among other slugs behind, did, by their instructions, make for that place, to rendezvous with the fleet; and Beaufort, seeing them as he was returning, took them for the English fleet, and wrote word to the King of France that he had passed by the English fleet, and the English fleet durst not meddle with him. The Court is all full of vests, only my Lord <abbr>St.</abbr> Albans not pinked but plain black; and they say the King says the pinking upon white makes them look too much like magpies, and therefore hath bespoke one of plain velvet. Thence to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s by coach, and spoke, at four o’clock or five, with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, newly come from the House, where they have sat all this day and not come to an end of the debate how the money shall be raised. He tells me that what I proposed to him the other day was what he had himself thought on and determined, and that he believes it will speedily be done⁠—the making Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes a Commissioner, and bringing somebody else to be Comptroller, and that (which do not please me, I confess, for my own particulars, so well as Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes) will, I fear, be Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, for he is the only fit man for it. Away from him and took up my wife, and left her at Temple Bar to buy some lace for a petticoat, and I took coach and away to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Viner’s about a little business, and then home, and by and by to my chamber, and there late upon making up an account for the Board to pass tomorrow, if I can get them, for the clearing all my imprest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3015" id="noteref-3015" epub:type="noteref">3015</a> bills, which if I can do, will be to my very good satisfaction.

The waters so high in the roads, by the late rains, that our letters come not in till today, and now I understand that my father is got well home, but had a painful journey of it. At noon with Lord Brouncker to <abbr>St.</abbr> Ellen’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3016" id="noteref-3016" epub:type="noteref">3016</a> where the master of the late Pope’s Head Tavern is now set up again, and there dined at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Warren’s cost, a very good dinner. Here my Lord Brouncker proffered to carry me and my wife into a play at Court tonight, and to lend me his coach home, which tempted me much; but I shall not do it. Thence rose from table before dinner ended, and homewards met my wife, and so away by coach towards Lovett’s (in the way wondering at what a good pretty wench our Barker makes, being now put into good clothes, and fashionable, at my charge; but it becomes her, so that I do not now think much of it, and is an example of the power of good clothes and dress), where I stood godfather. But it was pretty, that, being a Protestant, a man stood by and was my Proxy to answer for me. A priest christened it, and the boy’s name is Samuel. The ceremonies many, and some foolish. The priest in a gentleman’s dress, more than my own; but is a Capuchin, one of the Queen-mother’s priests. He did give my proxy and the woman proxy (my Lady Bills,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3017" id="noteref-3017" epub:type="noteref">3017</a> absent, had a proxy also) good advice to bring up the child, and, at the end, that he ought never to marry the child nor the godmother, nor the godmother the child or the godfather: but, which is strange, they say that the mother of the child and the godfather may marry. By and by the Lady Bills come in, a well-bred but crooked woman. The poor people of the house had good wine, and a good cake; and she a pretty woman in her lying-in dress. It cost me near 40<abbr>s.</abbr> the whole christening: to midwife 20<abbr>s.</abbr>, nurse 10<abbr>s.</abbr>, maid 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>, and the coach 5<abbr>s.</abbr> I was very well satisfied with what I have done, and so home and to the office, and thence to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, and there hear how the business of buying off the Chimney-money is passed in the House; and so the King to be satisfied some other way, and the King supplied with the money raised by this purchasing off of the chimnies. So home, mightily pleased in mind that I have got my bills of imprest cleared by bills signed this day, to my good satisfaction. To supper, and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-29">19th</time>. Up, and by coach to my Lord Ashly’s, and thence (he being gone out), to the Exchequer chamber, and there find him and my Lord Bellasses about my Lord Bellasses’ accounts, which was the business I went upon. This was soon ended, and then I with Creed back home to my house, and there he and I did even accounts for salary, and by that time dinner was ready, and merry at dinner, and then abroad to Povy’s, who continues as much confounded in all his business as ever he was; and would have had me paid money, as like a fool as himself, which I troubled him in refusing; but I did persist in it. After a little more discourse, I left them, and to Whitehall, where I met with Sir Robert Viner, who told me a little of what, in going home, I had seen; also a little of the disorder and mutiny among the seamen at the Treasurer’s office, which did trouble me then and all day since, considering how many more seamen will come to town every day, and no money for them. A Parliament sitting, and the Exchange close by, and an enemy to hear of, and laugh at it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3018" id="noteref-3018" epub:type="noteref">3018</a> Viner too, and Backewell, were sent for this afternoon; and was before the King and his Cabinet about money; they declaring they would advance no more, it being discoursed of in the House of Parliament for the King to issue out his privy-seals to them to command them to trust him, which gives them reason to decline trusting. But more money they are persuaded to lend, but so little that (with horrour I speake it), coming after the Council was up, with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, Lord Brouncker, and myself, I did lay the state of our condition before the Duke of York, that the fleet could not go out without several things it wanted, and we could not have without money, particularly rum and bread, which we have promised the man Swan to helpe him to £200 of his debt, and a few other small sums of £200 a piece to some others, and that I do foresee the Duke of York would call us to an account why the fleet is not abroad, and we cannot answer otherwise than our want of money; and that indeed we do not do the King any service now, but do rather abuse and betray his service by being there, and seeming to do something, while we do not. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret asked me (just in these words, for in this and all the rest I set down the very words for memory sake, if there should be occasion) whether £50 or £60 would do us any good; and when I told him the very rum man<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3019" id="noteref-3019" epub:type="noteref">3019</a> must have £200, he held up his eyes as if we had asked a million. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry told the Duke of York plainly he did rather desire to have his commission called in than serve in so ill a place, where he cannot do the King service, and I did concur in saying the same. This was all very plain, and the Duke of York did confess that he did not see how we could do anything without a present supply of £20,000, and that he would speak to the King next Council day, and I promised to wait on him to put him in mind of it. This I set down for my future justification, if need be, and so we broke up, and all parted, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry being not very well, but I believe made much worse by this night’s sad discourse. So I home by coach, considering what the consequence of all this must be in a little time. Nothing but distraction and confusion; which makes me wish with all my heart that I were well and quietly settled with what little I have got at Brampton, where I might live peaceably, and study, and pray for the good of the King and my country. Home, and to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, where I saw my Lady, who is now come downstairs after a great sickness. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten was at the pay today, and tells me how rude the men were, but did go away quietly, being promised pay on Wednesday next. God send us money for it! So to the office, and then to supper and to bed. Among other things proposed in the House today, to give the King in lieu of chimneys, there was the bringing up of sealed paper, such as Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes showed me tonight, at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, is used in Spain, and brings the King a great revenue; but it shows what shifts we are put to too much.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-30">20th</time>. Up, and all the morning at the office, where none met but myself. So I walked a good while with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gawden in the garden, who is lately come from the fleet at the buoy of the Nore, and he do tell me how all the sober commanders, and even Sir Thomas Allen himself, do complain of the ill government of the fleet. How Holmes and Jennings have commanded all the fleet this yeare, that nothing is done upon deliberation, but if a sober man give his opinion otherwise than the Prince would have it the Prince would cry, “Damn him, do you follow your orders, and that is enough for you.” He tells me he hears of nothing but of swearing and drinking and whoring, and all manner of profaneness, quite through the whole fleet. He being gone, there comes to me Commissioner Middleton, whom I took on purpose to walk in the garden with me, and to learn what he observed when the fleet was at Portsmouth. He says that the fleet was in such a condition, as to discipline, as if the Devil had commanded it; so much wickedness of all sorts. Enquiring how it come to pass that so many ships miscarried this year, he tells me that he enquired; and the pilots do say, that they dare not do nor go but as the Captains will have them; and if they offer to do otherwise, the Captains swear they will run them through. He says that he heard Captain Digby<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3020" id="noteref-3020" epub:type="noteref">3020</a> (my Lord of Bristoll’s son, a young fellow that never was but one year, if that, in the fleet) say that he did hope he should not see a tarpaulin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3021" id="noteref-3021" epub:type="noteref">3021</a> have the command of a ship within this twelve months. He observed while he was on board the Admiral, when the fleet was at Portsmouth, that there was a faction there. Holmes commanded all on the Prince’s side, and Sir Jeremy Smith on the Duke’s, and everybody that come did apply themselves to one side or other; and when the Duke of Albemarle was gone away to come hither, then Sir Jeremy Smith did hang his head, and walked in the General’s ship but like a private commander. He says he was on board <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">The Prince</i>, when the news come of the burning of London; and all the Prince said was, that now Shipton’s prophecy was out;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3022" id="noteref-3022" epub:type="noteref">3022</a> and he heard a young commander presently swear, that now a citizen’s wife that would not take under half a piece before, would be occupied for half-a-crown: and made mighty sport of it. He says that Hubberd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3023" id="noteref-3023" epub:type="noteref">3023</a> that commanded this year the Admiral’s ship is a proud conceited fellow (though I thought otherwise of him), and fit to command a single ship but not a fleet, and he do wonder that there hath not been more mischief this year than there hath. He says the fleet come to anchor between the Horse and the Island, so that when they came to weigh many of the ships could not turn, but run foul of the Horse, and there stuck, but that the weather was good. He says that nothing can do the King more disservice, nor please the standing officers of the ship better than these silly commanders that now we have, for they sign to anything that their officers desire of them, nor have judgment to contradict them if they would. He told me other good things, which made me bless God that we have received no greater disasters this year than we have, though they have been the greatest that ever was known in England before, put all their losses of the King’s ships by want of skill and seamanship together from the beginning. He being gone, comes Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, and he and I walked together awhile, discoursing upon the sad condition of the times, what need we have, and how impossible it is to get money. He told me my Lord Chancellor the other day did ask him how it come to pass that his friend Pepys do so much magnify all things to worst, as I did on Sunday last, in the bad condition of the fleet. Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret tells me that he answered him, that I was but the mouth of the rest, and spoke what they have dictated to me; which did, as he says, presently take off his displeasure. So that I am well at present with him, but I must have a care not to be over busy in the office again, and burn my fingers. He tells me he wishes he had sold his place at some good rate to somebody or other at the beginning of the war, and that he would do it now, but no body will deal with him for it. He tells me the Duke of Albemarle is very much discontented, and the Duke of York do not, it seems, please him. He tells me that our case as to money is not to be made good at present, and therefore wishes a good and speedy peace before it be too late, and from his discourse methinks I find that there is something moving towards it. Many people at the office, but having no more of the office I did put it off till the next meeting. Thence, with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, home to dinner, with him, my Lady and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ashburnham, the Cofferer. Here they talk that the Queen hath a great mind to alter her fashion, and to have the feet seen, which she loves mightily; and they do believe that it [will] come into it in a little time. Here I met with the King’s declaration<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3024" id="noteref-3024" epub:type="noteref">3024</a> about his proceedings with the King of Denmark, and particularly the business of Bergen; but it is so well writ, that, if it be true, the King of Denmark is one of the most absolute wickedness in the world for a person of his quality. After dinner home, and there met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy by appointment, and there he and I all the afternoon, till late at night, evening of all accounts between us, which we did to both our satisfaction; but that which troubles me most is, that I am to refund to the ignoble Lord Peterborough what he had given us six months ago, because we did not supply him with money; but it is no great matter. He gone I to the office, and there did some business; and so home, my mind in good ease by having done with Povy in order to the adjusting of all my accounts in a few days. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-10-31">21st (Lord’s day)</time>. Up, and with my wife to church, and her new woman Barker with her the first time. The girle will, I think, do very well. Here a lazy sermon, and so home to dinner, and took in my Lady Penn and Peg (Sir William being below with the fleet), and mighty merry we were, and then after dinner presently (it being a mighty cool day) I by coach to Whitehall, and there attended the Cabinet, and was called in before the King and them to give an account of our want of money for Tangier, which troubles me that it should be my place so often and so soon after one another to come to speak there of their wants⁠—the thing of the world that they love least to hear of, and that which is no welcome thing to be the solicitor for⁠—and to see how like an image the King sat and could not speak one word when I had delivered myself was very strange; only my Lord Chancellor did ask me, whether I thought it was in nature at this time to help us to anything. So I was referred to another meeting of the Lords Commissioners for Tangier and my Lord Treasurer, and so went away, and by coach home, where I spent the evening in reading Stillingfleet’s defence of the Archbishopp,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3025" id="noteref-3025" epub:type="noteref">3025</a> the part about Purgatory, a point I had never considered before, what was said for it or against it, and though I do believe we are in the right, yet I do not see any great matter in this book. So to supper; and my people being gone, most of them, to bed, my boy and Jane and I did get two of my iron chests out of the cellar into my closet, and the money to my great satisfaction to see it there again, and the rather because the damp cellar spoils all my chests. This being done, and I weary, to bed. This afternoon walking with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cholmly long in the gallery, he told me, among many other things, how Harry Killigrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3026" id="noteref-3026" epub:type="noteref">3026</a> is banished the Court lately, for saying that my Lady Castlemayne was a little lecherous girle when she was young.⁠ ⁠… This she complained to the King of, and he sent to the Duke of York, whose servant he is, to turn him away. The Duke of York hath done it, but takes it ill of my Lady that he was not complained to first. She attended him to excute it, but ill blood is made by it. He told me how <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Williamson stood in a little place to have come into the House of Commons, and they would not choose him; they said, “No courtier.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3027" id="noteref-3027" epub:type="noteref">3027</a> And which is worse, Bab May went down in great state to Winchelsea with the Duke of York’s letters, not doubting to be chosen; and there the people chose a private gentleman in spite of him, and cried out they would have no Court pimp to be their burgess; which are things that bode very ill.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3028" id="noteref-3028" epub:type="noteref">3028</a> This afternoon I went to see and sat a good while with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin, and there was her sister Doll, with whom, contrary to all expectation, I did what I would, and might have done anything else.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-01">22nd</time>. Up, and by coach to Westminster Hall, there thinking to have met Betty Michell, who I heard yesterday stayed all night at her father’s, but she was gone. So I stayed a little and then down to the bridge by water, and there overtook her and her father. So saluted her and walked over London Bridge with them and there parted, the weather being very foul, and so to the Tower by water, and so home, where I find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Caesar playing the treble to my boy upon the Theorbo, the first time I heard him, which pleases me mightily. After dinner I carried him and my wife towards Westminster, by coach, myself ’lighting at the Temple, and there, being a little too soon, walked in the Temple Church, looking with pleasure on the monuments and epitaphs, and then to my Lord Belasses, where Creed and Povy by appointment met to discourse of some of their Tangier accounts between my Lord and Vernatty, who will prove a very knave. That being done I away with Povy to Whitehall, and thence I to Unthanke’s, and there take up my wife, and so home, it being very foule and dark. Being there come, I to the settling of some of my money matters in my chests, and evening some accounts, which I was at late, to my extraordinary content, and especially to see all things hit so even and right and with an apparent profit and advantage since my last accounting, but how much I cannot particularly yet come to adjudge.</p>

At noon Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten told me Sir Richard Ford would accept of one-third of my profit of our private man-of-war, and bear one-third of the charge, and be bound in the Admiralty, so I shall be excused being bound, which I like mightily of, and did draw up a writing, as well as I could, to that purpose and signed and sealed it, and so he and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford are to go to enter into bond this afternoon. Home to dinner, and after dinner, it being late, I down by water to Shadwell, to see Betty Michell, the first time I was ever at their new dwelling since the fire, and there find her in the house all alone. I find her mighty modest. But had her lips as much as I would, and indeed she is mighty pretty, that I love her exceedingly. I paid her £10 1<abbr>s.</abbr> that I received upon a ticket for her husband, which is a great kindness I have done them, and having kissed her as much as I would, I away, poor wretch, and down to Deptford to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes ordering of the pay of some ships there, which he do most miserably, and so home. Bagwell’s wife, seeing me come the fields way, did get over her pales to come after and talk with me, which she did for a good way, and so parted, and I home, and to the office, very busy, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-03">24th</time>. Up, and down to the Old Swan, and there find little Michell come to his new shop that he hath built there in the room of his house that was burned. I hope he will do good here. I drank and bade him joy, for I love him and his wife well, him for his care, and her for her person, and so to Whitehall, where we attended the Duke; and to all our complaints for want of money, which now we are tired out with making, the Duke only tells us that he is sorry for it, and hath spoke to the King of it, and money we shall have as soon as it can be found; and though all the issue of the war lies upon it, yet that is all the answer we can get, and that is as bad or worse than nothing. Thence to Westminster Hall, where the term is begun, and I did take a turn or two, and so away by coach to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Viner’s, and there received some money, and then home and to dinner. After dinner to little business, and then abroad with my wife, she to see her brother, who is sick, and she believes is from some discontent his wife hath given him by her loose carriage, which he is told, and he hath found has been very suspicious in his absence, which I am sorry for. I to the Hall and there walked long, among others talking with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hayes, Prince Rupert’s Secretary, a very ingenious man, and one, I think, fit to contract some friendship with. Here I stayed late, walking to and again, hearing how the Parliament proceeds, which is mighty slowly in the settling of the money business, and great factions growing every day among them. I am told also how Holmes did last Sunday deliver in his articles to the King and Cabinet against [Sir Jeremy] Smith, and that Smith hath given in his answer, and lays his not accompanying the fleet to his pilot, who would not undertake to carry the ship further; which the pilot acknowledges. The thing is not accommodated, but only taken up, and both sides commanded to be quiet; but no peace like to be. The Duke of Albemarle is Smith’s friend, and hath publicly swore that he would never go to sea again unless Holmes’s commission were taken from him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3029" id="noteref-3029" epub:type="noteref">3029</a> I find by Hayes that they did expect great glory in coming home in so good condition as they did with the fleet, and therefore I the less wonder that the Prince was distasted with my discourse the other day about the bad state of the fleet. But it pleases me to hear that he did expect great thanks, and lays the fault of the want of it upon the fire, which deadened everything, and the glory of his services. About seven at night home, and called my wife, and, it being moonshine, took her into the garden, and there layed open our condition as to our estate, and the danger of my having it [his money] all in the house at once, in case of any disorder or troubles in the State, and therefore resolved to remove part of it to Brampton, and part some whither else, and part in my own house, which is very necessary, and will tend to our safety, though I shall not think it safe out of my own sight. So to the office, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

At noon home to dinner, where the two <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Daniels come to see us, and dined with us. After dinner I out with my wife to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s, where she hath not been a great while, from some little unkindness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3030" id="noteref-3030" epub:type="noteref">3030</a> of my wife’s to her when she was last here, but she received us with mighty respect and discretion, and was making herself mighty fine to go to a great ball tonight at Court, being the Queen’s birthday; so the ladies for this one day do wear laces, but to put them off again tomorrow. Thence I to my Lord Brouncker’s, and with him to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams’s where we met Knipp. I was glad to see the jade. Made her sing; and she told us they begin at both houses to act on Monday next. But I fear, after all this sorrow, their gains will be but little. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams says, the Duke’s house will now be much the better of the two, because of their women; which I am glad to hear. Thence with Lord Brouncker to Whitehall and there spoke with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry about some office business, and then I away to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s, and there saw her new closet, which is mighty rich and fine. Her daughter Betty grows mighty pretty. Thence with my wife home and to do business at the office. Then to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, who tells me that the House of Parliament makes mighty little haste in settling the money, and that he knows not when it will be done; but they fall into faction, and libells have been found in the House. Among others, one yesterday, wherein they reckon up diverse great sums to be given away by the King, among others, £10,000 to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry, for weare and teare (the point he stood upon to advance that sum by, for them to give the King); Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret £50,000 for something else, I think supernumeraries; and so to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Matt.</abbr> Wren £5,000 for passing the Canary Company’s patent; and so a great many other sums to other persons. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

Up, and all the morning and most of the afternoon within doors, beginning to set my accounts in order from before this fire, I being behindhand with them ever since; and this day I got most of my tradesmen to bring in their bills and paid them. Dined at home, and busy again after dinner, and then abroad by water to Westminster Hall, where I walked till the evening, and then out, the first time I ever was abroad with Doll Lane, to the Dog tavern, and there drank with her, a bad face, but good bodied girle. Did nothing but salute and play with her and talk, and thence away by coach, home, and so to do a little more in my accounts, and then to supper and to bed. Nothing done in the House yet as to the finishing of the bill for money, which is a mighty sad thing, all lying at stake for it.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-06">27th</time>. Up, and there comes to see me my Lord Belasses, which was a great honour. He tells me great news, yet but what I suspected, that Vernatty is fled, and so hath cheated him and twenty more, but most of all, I doubt, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy. Thence to talk about public business; he tells me how the two Houses begin to be troublesome; the Lords to have quarrels one with another. My Lord Duke of Buckingham having said to the Lord Chancellor (who is against the passing of the Bill for prohibiting the bringing over of Irish cattle), that whoever was against the Bill, was there led to it by an Irish interest, or an Irish understanding, which is as much as to say he is a foole; this bred heat from my Lord Chancellor, and something he [Buckingham] said did offend my Lord of Ossory<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3031" id="noteref-3031" epub:type="noteref">3031</a> (my Lord Duke of Ormond’s son), and they two had hard words, upon which the latter sends a challenge to the former; of which the former complains to the House, and so the business is to be heard on Monday next.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3032" id="noteref-3032" epub:type="noteref">3032</a> Then as to the Commons; some ugly knives, like poignards, to stab people with, about two or three hundred of them were brought in yesterday to the House, found in one of the house’s rubbish that was burned, and said to be the house of a Catholic. This and several letters out of the country, saying how high the Catholics are everywhere and bold in the owning their religion, have made the Commons mad, and they presently voted that the King be desired to put all Catholics out of employment, and other high things; while the business of money hangs in the hedge. So that upon the whole, God knows we are in a sad condition like to be, there being the very beginnings of the late troubles. He gone, I at the office all the morning. At noon home to dinner, where <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce and her boy and Knipp, who sings as well, and is the best company in the world, dined with us, and infinite merry. The playhouses begin to play next week. Towards evening I took them out to the New Exchange, and there my wife bought things, and I did give each of them a pair of Jesimy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3033" id="noteref-3033" epub:type="noteref">3033</a> plain gloves, and another of white. Here Knipp and I walked up and down to see handsome faces, and did see several. Then carried each of them home, and with great pleasure and content, home myself, where, having writ several letters, I home, and there, upon some serious discourse between my wife and I upon the business, I called to us my brother, and there broke to him our design to send him into the country with some part of our money, and so did seriously discourse the whole thing, and then away to supper and to bed. I pray God give a blessing to our resolution, for I do much fear we shall meet with speedy distractions for want of money.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-07">28th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up, and to church with my wife, and then home, and there is come little Michell and his wife, I sent for them, and also comes Captain Guy to dine with me, and he and I much talk together. He cries out of the discipline of the fleet, and confesses really that the true English valour we talk of is almost spent and worn out; few of the commanders doing what they should do, and he much fears we shall therefore be beaten the next year. He assures me we were beaten home the last June fight, and that the whole fleet was ashamed to hear of our bonefires. He commends Smith, and cries out of Holmes for an idle, proud, conceited, though stout fellow. He tells me we are to owe the losse of so many ships on the sands, not to any fault of the pilots, but to the weather; but in this I have good authority to fear there was something more. He says the Dutch do fight in very good order, and we in none at all. He says that in the July fight, both the Prince and Holmes had their belly-fulls, and were fain to go aside; though, if the wind had continued, we had utterly beaten them. He do confess the whole to be governed by a company of fools, and fears our ruin. After dinner he gone, I with my brother to Whitehall and he to Westminster Abbey. I presently to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, and there met widow Burroughes and Doll, and did tumble them all the afternoon as I pleased, and having given them a bottle of wine I parted and home by boat (my brother going by land), and thence with my wife to sit and sup with my uncle and aunt Wight, and see Woolly’s wife, who is a pretty woman, and after supper, being very merry, in abusing my aunt with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Venner, we home, and I to do something in my accounts, and so to bed. The <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Revenge</i> having her forecastle blown up with powder to the killing of some men in the River, and the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Diamond</i>’s being overset in the careening at Sheerness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3034" id="noteref-3034" epub:type="noteref">3034</a> are further marks of the method all the King’s work is now done in. The <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Foresight</i> also and another come to disasters in the same place this week in the cleaning; which is strange.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-08">29th</time>. Up, and to the office to do business, and thither comes to me Sir Thomas Teddiman, and he and I walked a good while in the garden together, discoursing of the disorder and discipline of the fleet, wherein he told me how bad everything is; but was very wary in speaking anything to the dishonour of the Prince or Duke of Albemarle, but do magnify my Lord Sandwich much before them both, for ability to serve the King, and do heartily wish for him here. For he fears that we shall be undone the next year, but that he will, however, see an end of it. To prevent the necessity of his dining with me I was forced to pretend occasion of going to Westminster, so away I went, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barber, the clerk, having a request to make to me to get him into employment, did walk along with me, and by water to Westminster with me, he professing great love to me, and an able clerk he is. When I come thither I find the new Lord Mayor Bolton<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3035" id="noteref-3035" epub:type="noteref">3035</a> a-swearing at the Exchequer, with some of the Aldermen and Livery; but, Lord! to see how meanely they now look, who upon this day used to be all little lords, is a sad sight and worthy consideration. And everybody did reflect with pity upon the poor City, to which they are now coming to choose and swear their Lord Mayor, compared with what it heretofore was. Thence by coach (having in the Hall bought me a velvet riding cap, cost me 20<abbr>s.</abbr>) to my tailor’s, and there bespoke a plain vest, and so to my goldsmith to bid him look out for some gold for me; and he tells me that ginnys, which I bought 2,000 of not long ago, and cost me but 18½<abbr>d.</abbr> change, will now cost me 22<abbr>d.</abbr>; and but very few to be had at any price. However, some more I will have, for they are very convenient, and of easy disposal. So home to dinner and to discourse with my brother upon his translation of my Lord Bacon’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Faber Fortunæ</i>, which I gave him to do and he has done it, but meanely; I am not pleased with it at all, having done it only literally, but without any life at all. About five o’clock I took my wife (who is mighty fine, and with a new fair pair of locks, which vex me, though like a foole I helped her the other night to buy them), and to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce’s, and there staying a little I away before to Whitehall, and into the new playhouse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3036" id="noteref-3036" epub:type="noteref">3036</a> there, the first time I ever was there, and the first play I have seen since before the great plague. By and by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce comes, bringing my wife and his, and Knipp. By and by the King and Queen, Duke and Duchess, and all the great ladies of the Court; which, indeed, was a fine sight. But the play being <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Love in a Tub</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3037" id="noteref-3037" epub:type="noteref">3037</a> a silly play, and though done by the Duke’s people, yet having neither Betterton nor his wife,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3038" id="noteref-3038" epub:type="noteref">3038</a> and the whole thing done ill, and being ill also, I had no manner of pleasure in the play. Besides, the House, though very fine, yet bad for the voice, for hearing. The sight of the ladies, indeed, was exceeding noble; and above all, my Lady Castlemayne. The play done by ten o’clock. I carried them all home, and then home myself, and well satisfied with the sight, but not the play, we with great content to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-09">30th</time>. Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning, and at noon home to dinner, and then to the office again, where late, very busy, and dispatching much business. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater staying most of the afternoon abroad, he come to me, poor man, to make excuse, and it was that he had been looking out for a little house for his family. His wife being much frightened in the country with the discourses of troubles and disorders like to be, and therefore durst not be from him, and therefore he is forced to bring her to town that they may be together. This is now the general apprehension of all people; particulars I do not know, but my own fears are also great, and I do think it time to look out to save something, if a storm should come. At night home to supper, and singing with my wife, who hath lately begun to learn, and I think will come to do something, though her ear is not good, nor I, I confess, have patience enough to teach her, or hear her sing now and then a note out of tune, and am to blame that I cannot bear with that in her which is fit I should do with her as a learner, and one that I desire much could sing, and so should encourage her. This I was troubled at, for I do find that I do put her out of heart, and make her fearful to sing before me. So after supper to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1666-11-10">31st</time>. Out with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten toward Whitehall, being in pain in my cods by being squeezed the other night in a little coach when I carried Pierce and his wife and my people. But I hope I shall be soon well again. This day is a great day at the House, so little to do with the Duke of York, but soon parted. Coming out of the Court I met Colonel Atkins, who tells me the whole city rings today of Sir Jeremy Smith’s killing of Holmes in a duell, at which I was not much displeased, for I fear every day more and more mischief from the man, if he lives; but the thing is not true, for in my coach I did by and by meet Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jer.</abbr> Smith going to Court. So I by coach to my goldsmith, there to see what gold I can get, which is but little, and not under 22<abbr>d.</abbr> So away home to dinner, and after dinner to my closet, where I spent the whole afternoon till late at evening of all my accounts public and private, and to my great satisfaction I do find that I do bring my accounts to a very near balance, notwithstanding all the hurries and troubles I have been put to by the late fire, that I have not been able to even my accounts since July last before; and I bless God I do find that I am worth more than ever I yet was, which is £6,200, for which the Holy Name of God be praised! and my other accounts of Tangier in a very plain and clear condition, that I am not liable to any trouble from them; but in fear great I am, and I perceive the whole city is, of some distractions and disorders among us, which God of his goodness prevent! Late to supper with my wife and brother, and then to bed. And thus ends the month with an ill aspect, the business of the Navy standing wholly still. No credit, no goods sold us, nobody will trust. All we have to do at the office is to hear complaints for want of money. The Duke of York himself for now three weeks seems to rest satisfied that we can do nothing without money, and that all must stand still till the King gets money, which the Parliament have been a great while about; but are so dissatisfied with the King’s management, and his giving himself up to pleasures, and not minding the calling to account any of his officers, and they observe so much the expense of the war, and yet that after we have made it the most we can, it do not amount to what they have given the King for the warn that they are backward of giving any more. However, £1,800,000 they have voted, but the way of gathering it has taken up more time than is fit to be now lost: The seamen grow very rude, and everything out of order; commanders having no power over their seamen, but the seamen do what they please. Few stay on board, but all coming running up hither to town, and nobody can with justice blame them, we owing them so much money; and their families must starve if we do not give them money, or they procure upon their tickets from some people that will trust them. A great folly is observed by all people in the King’s giving leave to so many merchantmen to go abroad this winter, and some upon voyages where it is impossible they should be back again by the spring, and the rest will be doubtful, but yet we let them go; what the reason of State is nobody can tell, but all condemn it. The Prince and Duke of Albemarle have got no great credit by this year’s service. Our losses both of reputation and ships having been greater than is thought have ever been suffered in all ages put together before; being beat home, and fleeing home the first fight, and then losing so many ships then and since upon the sands, and some falling into the enemy’s hands, and not one taken this yeare, but the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Ruby</i>, French prize, now at the end of the yeare, by the Frenchmen’s mistake in running upon us. Great folly in both Houses of Parliament, several persons falling together by the ears, among others in the House of Lords, the Duke of Buckingham and my Lord Ossory.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3039" id="noteref-3039" epub:type="noteref">3039</a> Such is our case, that everybody fears an invasion the next yeare; and for my part, I do methinks foresee great unhappiness coming upon us, and do provide for it by laying by something against a rainy day, dividing what I have, and laying it in several places, but with all faithfulness to the King in all respects; my grief only being that the King do not look after his business himself, and thereby will be undone both himself and his nation, it being not yet, I believe, too late if he would apply himself to it, to save all, and conquer the Dutch; but while he and the Duke of York mind their pleasure, as they do and nothing else, we must be beaten. So late with my mind in good condition of quiet after the settling all my accounts, and to bed.</p>
