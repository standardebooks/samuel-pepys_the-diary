			<article id="entry-1662-11-11" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-11">November 1st</time>. Up and after a little while with my workmen I went to my office, and then to our sitting all the morning. At noon with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creede, whom I found at my house, to the Trinity House, to a great dinner there, by invitacion, and much company. It seems one Captain Evans makes his Elder Brother’s dinner today. Among other discourses one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Oudant, secretary to the late Princess of Orange, did discourse of the convenience as to keeping the highways from being deep, by their horses, in Holland (and Flanders where the ground is as miry as ours is), going in their carts and, wagons as ours in coaches, wishing the same here as an expedient to make the ways better, and I think there is something in it, where there is breadth enough. Thence to my office, sent for to meet <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Leigh again, from Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Bennet. And he and I, with Wade and his intelligencer and labourers, to the Tower cellars, to make one tryall more; where we stayed two or three hours digging, and dug a great deal all under the arches, as it was now most confidently directed, and so seriously, and upon pretended good grounds, that I myself did truly expect to speed; but we missed of all: and so we went away the second time like fools. And to our office, whither, a coach being come, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Leigh goes home to Whitehall; and I by appointment to the Dolphin Tavern, to meet Wade and the other, <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Evett, who now do tell me plainly, that he that do put him upon this is one that had it from Barkestead’s own mouth, and was advised with by him, just before the King’s coming in, how to get it out, and had all the signs told him how and where it lay, and had always been the great confident of Barkestead even to the trusting him with his life and all he had. So that he did much convince me that there is good ground for what we go about. But I fear it may be that he did find some conveyance of it away, without the help of this man, before he died. But he is resolved to go to the party once more, and then to determine what we shall do further. So we parted, and I to my office, where after sending away my letters to the post I do hear that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes is resolved to turn part of our entry into a room and to divide the back yard between Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn and him, which though I do not see how it will annoy me much particularly, yet it do trouble me a little for fear it should, but I do not see how it can well unless in his desiring my coming to my back stairs, but for that I shall do as well as himself or Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who is most concerned to look after it.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-12">2nd (Lord’s day)</time>. Lay long with pleasure talking with my wife, in whom I never had greater content, blessed be God! than now, she continuing with the same care and thrift and innocence, so long as I keep her from occasions of being otherwise, as ever she was in her life, and keeps the house as well. To church, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills, after he had read the service, and shifted himself as he did the last day, preached a very ordinary sermon. So home to dinner with my wife. Then up into my new rooms which are almost finished, and there walked with great content talking with my wife till church time, and then to church, and there being a lazy preacher I slept out the sermon, and so home, and after visiting the two Sir Williams, who are both of them mending apace, I to my office preparing things against tomorrow for the Duke, and so home and to bed, with some pain,⁠ ⁠… having taken cold this morning in sitting too long barelegged to pare my corns. My wife and I spent a good deal of this evening in reading Du Bartas’ <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Imposture</i> and other parts which my wife of late has taken up to read, and is very fine as anything I meet with.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-13">3rd</time>. Up and with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes in his coach to Whitehall, to the Duke’s; but found him gone out a-hunting. Thence to my Lord Sandwich, from whom I receive every day more and more signs of his confidence and esteem of me. Here I met with Pierce the chirurgeon, who tells me that my Lady Castlemaine is with child; but though it be the King’s, yet her Lord being still in town, and sometimes seeing of her, though never to eat or lie together, it will be laid to him. He tells me also how the Duke of York is smitten in love with my Lady Chesterfield<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1583" id="noteref-1583" epub:type="noteref">1583</a> (a virtuous lady, daughter to my Lord of Ormond); and so much, that the duchess of York hath complained to the King and her father about it, and my Lady Chesterfield is gone into the country for it. At all which I am sorry; but it is the effect of idleness, and having nothing else to employ their great spirits upon. Thence with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creede and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore (who is got upon his legs and come to see my Lord) to Wilkinson’s, and there I did give them and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Howe their dinner of roast beef, cost me 5<abbr>s.</abbr>, and after dinner carried <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore as far as Paul’s in a coach, giving him direction about my law business, and there set him down, and I home and among my workmen, who happened of all sorts to meet to their making an end of a great many jobbs, so that after tomorrow I shall have but a little plastering and all the painting almost to do, which was good content to me. At night to my office, and did business; and there came to me <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wade and Evett, who have been again with their prime intelligencer, a woman, I perceive: and though we have missed twice, yet they bring such an account of the probability of the truth of the thing, though we are not certain of the place, that we shall set upon it once more; and I am willing and hopefull in it. So we resolved to set upon it again on Wednesday morning; and the woman herself will be there in a disguise, and confirm us in the place. So they took leave for the night, and I to my business, and then home to my wife and to supper and bed, my pain being going away. So by God’s great blessing my mind is in good condition of quiet.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-14">4th</time>. Lay long talking pleasantly with my wife in bed, it having rained, and do still, very much all night long. Up and to the office, where we sat till noon. This morning we had news by letters that Sir Richard Stayner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1584" id="noteref-1584" epub:type="noteref">1584</a> is dead at sea in the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Mary</i>, which is now come into Portsmouth from Lisbon; which we are sorry for, he being a very stout seaman. But there will be no great miss of him for all that. Dined at home with my wife, and all the afternoon among my workmen, and at night to my office to do business there, and then to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who is still sick, but his pain less than it was. He took occasion to talk with me about Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes’s intention to divide the entry and the yard, and so to keep him out of the yard, and forcing him to go through the garden to his house. Which he is vexed at, and I am glad to see that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes do use him just as he do me, and so I perceive it is not anything extraordinary his carriage to me in the matter of our houses, for this is worse than anything he has done to me, that he should give order for the stopping up of his way to his house without so much as advising with him or letting of him know it, and I confess that it is very highly and basely done of him. So to my office again, and after doing business there, then home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-15">5th</time>. Up and with my painters painting my dining room all day long till night, not stirring out at all. Only in the morning my Lady Batten did send to speak with me, and told me very civilly that she did not desire, nor hoped I did, that anything should pass between us but what was civil, though there was not the neighbourliness between her and my wife that was fit to be, and so complained of my maid’s mocking of her; when she called “Nan” to her maid within her own house, my maid Jane in the garden overheard her, and mocked her, and some other suchlike things she told me, and of my wife’s speaking unhandsomely of her; to all which I did give her a very respectfull answer, such as did please her, and am sorry indeed that this should be, though I do not desire there should be any acquaintance between my wife and her. But I promised to avoid such words and passages for the future. So home, and by and by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn did send for me to his bedside; and tell me how really Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes did resolve to have one of my rooms, and that he was very angry and hot, and said he would speak to the Duke. To which, knowing that all this was but to scare me, and to get him to put off his resolution of making up the entry, I did tell him plainly how I did not value his anger more, than he did mine, and that I should be willing to do what the Duke commanded, and I was sure to have justice of him, and that was all I did say to him about it, though I was much vexed, and after a little stay went home; and there telling my wife she did put me into heart, and resolve to offer him to change lodgings, and believe that that will one way or other bring us to some end in this dispute. At night I called up my maids, and schooled Jane, who did answer me so humbly and drolly about it, that though I seemed angry, I was much pleased with her and [my] wife also. So at night to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-16">6th</time>. At the office forenoon and afternoon till late at night, very busy answering my Lord Treasurer’s letter, and my mind troubled till we come to some end with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes about our lodgings, and so home. And after some pleasant discourse and supper to bed, and in my dream much troubled by being with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Will.</abbr> Swan, a great fanatic, my old acquaintance, and, methought, taken and led up with him for a plotter, all our discourse being at present about the late plots.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1662-11-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-17">7th</time>. Up and being by appointment called upon by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lee, he and I to the Tower, to make our third attempt upon the cellar. And now privately the woman, Barkestead’s great confident, is brought, who do positively say that this is the place which he did say the money was hid in, and where he and she did put up the £50,000<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1585" id="noteref-1585" epub:type="noteref">1585</a> in butter firkins; and the very day that he went out of England did say that neither he nor his would be the better for that money, and therefore wishing that she and hers might. And so left us, and we full of hope did resolve to dig all over the cellar, which by seven o’clock at night we performed. At noon we sent for a dinner, and upon the head of a barrel dined very merrily, and to work again. Between times, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lee, who had been much in Spain, did tell me pretty stories of the customs and other things, as I asked him, of the country, to my great content. But at last we saw we were mistaken; and after digging the cellar quite through, and removing the barrels from one side to the other, we were forced to pay our porters, and give over our expectations, though I do believe there must be money hid somewhere by him, or else he did delude this woman in hopes to oblige her to further serving him, which I am apt to believe. Thence by coach to Whitehall, and at my Lord’s lodgings did write a letter, he not being within, to tell him how things went, and so away again, only hearing that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Sarah is married, I did go upstairs again and joy her and kiss her, she owning of it; and it seems it is to a cook. I am glad she is disposed of, for she grows old, and is very painfull<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1586" id="noteref-1586" epub:type="noteref">1586</a> and one I have reason to wish well for her old service to me. Then to my brother’s, where my wife, by my order, is tonight to stay a night or two while my house is made clean, and thence home, where I am angry to see, instead of the house made in part clean, all the pewter goods and other things are brought up to scouring, which makes the house ten times worse, at which I was very much displeased, but cannot help it. So to my office to set down my journal, and so home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-18">8th</time>. All the morning sitting at the office, and after that dined alone at home, and so to the office again till 9 o’clock, being loth to go home, the house is so dirty, and my wife at my brother’s. So home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-19">9th (Lord’s day)</time>. Lay alone a good while, my mind busy about pleading tomorrow to the Duke if there shall be occasion for this chamber that I lie in against Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes. Then up, and after being ready walked to my brother’s, where my wife is, calling at many churches, and then to the Temple, hearing a bit there too, and observing that in the streets and churches the Sunday is kept in appearance as well as I have known it at any time. Then to dinner to my brother’s, only he and my wife, and after dinner to see <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore, who is pretty well, and he and I to <abbr>St.</abbr> Gregory’s, where I escaped a great fall down the staires of the gallery: so into a pew there and heard <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ball<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1587" id="noteref-1587" epub:type="noteref">1587</a> make a very good sermon, though short of what I expected, as for the most part it do fall out. So home with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore to his chamber, and after a little talk I walked home to my house and stayed at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s. Till late at night with him and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, with whom we did abundance of most excellent discourse of former passages of sea commanders and officers of the navy, and so home and to bed, with my mind well at ease but only as to my chamber, which I fear to lose.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-20">10th</time>. Up betimes and to set my workmen to work, and then a little to the office, and so with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and myself by coach to Whitehall, to the Duke, who, after he was ready, did take us into his closet. Thither come my Lord General Monk, and did privately talk with the Duke about having the life-guards pass through the City today only for show and to fright people, for I perceive there are great fears abroad; for all which I am troubled and full of doubt that things will not go well. He being gone, we fell to business of the Navy. Among other things, how to pay off this fleet that is now come from Portugal; the King of Portugal sending them home, he having no more use for them, which we wonder at, that his condition should be so soon altered. And our landmen also are coming back, being almost starved in that poor country. Having done here I went by my Lord Sandwich’s, who was not at home, and so to Westminster Hall, where full of term, and here met with many about business, among others my cousin Roger Pepys, who is all for a composition with my uncle Thomas, which upon any fair terms I am for also and desire it. Thence by water, and so by land to my Lord Crew’s, and dined with him and his brother, I know not his name; where very good discourse; among others, of France’s intention to make a patriarch of his own, independent from the Pope, by which he will be able to cope with the Spaniard in all councils, which hitherto he has never done. My Lord Crew told us how he heard my Lord of Holland<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1588" id="noteref-1588" epub:type="noteref">1588</a> say that, being Embassador about the match with the Queen-Mother that now is, the King of France<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1589" id="noteref-1589" epub:type="noteref">1589</a> insisted upon a dispensation from the Pope, which my Lord Holland making a question of, and that he was commanded to yield to nothing to the prejudice of our religion, says the King of France, “You need not fear that, for if the Pope will not dispense with the match, my Bishopp of Paris shall.” By and by come in great <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Swinfen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1590" id="noteref-1590" epub:type="noteref">1590</a> the Parliament-man, who, among other discourse of the rise and fall of familys, told us of Bishopp Bridgeman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1591" id="noteref-1591" epub:type="noteref">1591</a> (brother of Sir Orlando) who lately hath bought a seat anciently of the Levers, and then the Ashtons; and so he hath in his great hall window (having repaired and beautified the house) caused four great places to be left for coates of armes. In one, he hath put the Levers, with this motto, “<i xml:lang="la">Olim.</i>” In another the Ashtons, with this, “<i xml:lang="la">Heri.</i>” In the next his own, with this, “<i xml:lang="la">Hodie.</i>” In the fourth nothing but this motto, “<i xml:lang="la">Cras nescio cujus.</i>” Thence towards my brother’s; met with Jack Cole in Fleet Street, and he and I went into his cousin Mary Cole’s (whom I never saw since she was married), and drank a pint of wine and much good discourse. I found him a little conceited, but he had good things in him, and a man may know the temper of the City by him, he being of a general conversation, and can tell how matters go; and upon that score I will encourage his acquaintance. Thence to my brother’s, and taking my wife up, carried her to Charing Cross, and there showed her the Italian motion, much after the nature of what I showed her a while since in Covent Garden. Their puppets here are somewhat better, but their motions not at all. Thence by coach to my Lady’s, and, hiding my wife with Sarah below, I went up and heard some music with my Lord, and afterwards discoursed with him alone, and so good night to him and below, having sent for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, had thought to have shown my wife a play before the King, but it is so late that we could not, and so we took coach, and taking up Sarah at my brother’s with their night geare we went home, and I to my office to settle matters, and so home and to bed. This morning in the Duke’s chamber Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes did break to me his desire about my chamber, which I did put off to another time to discourse of, he speaking to me very kindly to make me the less trouble myself, hoping to save myself and to contrive something or other to pleasure him as well, though I know not well what. The town, I hear, is full of discontents, and all know of the King’s new bastard by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Haslerigge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1592" id="noteref-1592" epub:type="noteref">1592</a> and as far as I can hear will never be contented with Episcopacy, they are so cruelly set for Presbytery, and the Bishopps carry themselves so high, that they are never likely to gain anything upon them.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-21">11th</time>. All the morning sitting at the office, and then to dinner with my wife, and so to the office again (where a good while <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bland was with me, telling me very fine things in merchandize, which, but that the trouble of my office do so cruelly hinder me, I would take some pains in) till late at night. Towards the evening I, as I have done for three or four nights, studying something of Arithmetique, which do please me well to see myself come forward. So home, to supper, and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-22">12th</time>. At my office most of the morning, after I had done among my painters, and sent away <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shaw and Hawly, who came to give me a visit this morning. Shaw it seems is newly remarried to a rich widow. At noon dined at home with my wife, and by and by, by my wife’s appointment came two young ladies, sisters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1593" id="noteref-1593" epub:type="noteref">1593</a> acquaintances of my wife’s brother’s, who are desirous to wait upon some ladies, and proffer their service to my wife. The youngest, indeed, hath a good voice, and sings very well, besides other good qualitys; but I fear hath been bred up with too great liberty for my family, and I fear greater inconveniences of expenses, and my wife’s liberty will follow, which I must study to avoid till I have a better purse; though, I confess, the gentlewoman, being pretty handsome, and singing, makes me have a good mind to her. Anon I took them by coach and carried them to a friend’s of theirs, in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and there I left them and I to the Temple by appointment to my cousin Roger’s chamber, where my uncle Thomas and his son Thomas met us, I having hoped that they would have agreed with me to have had [it] ended by my cousin Roger, but they will have two strangers to be for them against two others of mine, and so we parted without doing anything till the two send me the names of their arbiters. Thence I walked home, calling a little in Paul’s Churchyard, and, I thank God, can read and never buy a book, though I have a great mind to it. So to the Dolphin Tavern near home, by appointment, and there met with Wade and Evett, and have resolved to make a new attempt upon another discovery, in which God give us better fortune than in the other, but I have great confidence that there is no cheat in these people, but that they go upon good grounds, though they have been mistaken in the place of the first. From thence, without drinking a drop of wine, home to my office and there made an end, though late, of my collection of the prices of masts for these twelve years to this day, in order to the buying of some of Wood, and I bound it up in painted paper to lie by as a book for future use. So home and to supper and to bed, and a little before and after we were in bed we had much talk and difference between us about my wife’s having a woman, which I seemed much angry at, that she should go so far in it without consideration and my being consulted with. So to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-23" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-23">13th</time>. Up and began our discontent again and sorely angered my wife, who indeed do live very lonely, but I do perceive that it is want of work that do make her and all other people think of ways of spending their time worse, and this I owe to my building, that do not admit of her undertaking anything of work, because the house has been and is still so dirty. I to my office, and there sat all the morning and dined with discontent with my wife at noon, and so to my office, and there this afternoon we had our first meeting upon our commission of inspecting the Chest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1594" id="noteref-1594" epub:type="noteref">1594</a> and there met Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir Francis Clerke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1595" id="noteref-1595" epub:type="noteref">1595</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Heath, Attorney of the Dutchy, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Prinn, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Rider, <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Cocke, and myself. Our first work to read over the Institution, which is a decree in Chancery in the year 1617, upon an inquisition made at Rochester about that time into the revenues of the Chest, which had then, from the year 1588 or 1590, by the advice of the Lord High Admiral and principal officers then being, by consent of the seamen, been settled, paying sixpence per month, according to their wages then, which was then but 10<abbr>s.</abbr> which is now 24<abbr>s.</abbr> We adjourned to a fortnight hence. So broke up, and I to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who is now pretty well, but lies in bed still; he cannot rise to stand. Then to my office late, and this afternoon my wife in her discontent sent me a letter, which I am in a quandary what to do, whether to read it or not, but I purpose not, but to burn it before her face, that I may put a stop to more of this nature. But I must think of some way, either to find her some body to keep her company, or to set her to work, and by employment to take up her thoughts and time. After doing what I had to do I went home to supper, and there was very sullen to my wife, and so went to bed and to sleep (though with much ado, my mind being troubled) without speaking one word to her.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-24" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-24">14th</time>. She begun to talk in the morning and to be friends, believing all this while that I had read her letter, which I perceive by her discourse was full of good counsel, and relating the reason of her desiring a woman, and how little charge she did intend it to be to me, so I begun and argued it as full and plain to her, and she to reason it highly to me, to put her away, and take one of the Bowyers if I did dislike her, that I did resolve when the house is ready she shall try her for a while; the truth is, I having a mind to have her come for her music and dancing. So up and about my papers all the morning, and her brother coming I did tell him my mind plain, who did assure me that they were both of the sisters very humble and very poor, and that she that we are to have would carry herself so. So I was well contented and spent part of the morning at my office, and so home and to dinner, and after dinner, finding Sarah to be discontented at the news of this woman, I did begin in my wife’s chamber to talk to her and tell her that it was not out of unkindness to her, but my wife came up, and I perceive she is not too reconciled to her whatever the matter is, that I perceive I shall not be able to keep her, though she is as good a servant (only a little pettish) that ever I desire to have, and a creditable servant. So she desired leave to go out to look [for] a service, and did, for which I am troubled, and fell out highly afterwards with my wife about it. So to my office, where we met this afternoon about answering a great letter of my Lord Treasurer’s, and that done to my office drawing up a letter to him, and so home to supper.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-25">15th</time>. All the morning at the office sitting, dined with my wife pleasantly at home, then among my painters, and by and by went to my Civil Lawyers about my uncle’s suit, and so home again and saw my painters make an end of my house this night, which is my great joy, and so to my office and did business till ten at night, and so home and to supper, and after reading part of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Bussy d’Ambois</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1596" id="noteref-1596" epub:type="noteref">1596</a> a good play I bought today, to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-26">16th (Lord’s day)</time>. About 3 o’clock in the morning waked with a rude noise among Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes his servants (he not being yet come to his lodgings), who are the rudest people but they that lived before, one <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Davis, that ever I knew in my life. To sleep again, and after long talking pleasantly with my wife, up and to church, where <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Goodyer, now <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Buckworth, was churched. I love the woman for her gravity above any in the parish. So home and to dinner with my wife with great content, and after dinner walked up and down my house, which is now almost finished, there being nothing to do but the glazier and furniture to put up. By and by comes Tom, and after a little talk I with him towards his end, but seeing many strangers and coaches coming to our church, and finding that it was a sermon to be preached by a probationer for the Turkey Company<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1597" id="noteref-1597" epub:type="noteref">1597</a> to be sent to Smyrna, I returned thither. And several Turkey merchants filled all the best pews (and some in ours) in the Church, but a most pitiful sermon it was upon a text in Zachariah, and a great time he spent to show whose son Zachary was, and to prove Malachi to be the last prophet before John the Baptist. Home and to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who gets strength, but still keeps his bed. Then home and to my office to do some business there, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-27">17th</time>. To the Duke’s today, but he is gone a-hunting, and therefore I to my Lord Sandwich’s, and having spoke a little with him about his businesses, I to Westminster Hall and there stayed long doing many businesses, and so home by the Temple and other places doing the like, and at home I found my wife dressing by appointment by her woman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1598" id="noteref-1598" epub:type="noteref">1598</a> that I think is to be, and her other sister being here today with her and my wife’s brother, I took <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed, that came to dine, to an ordinary behind the ’Change, and there dined together, and after dinner home and there spent an hour or two till almost dark, talking with my wife, and making <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gosnell sing; and then, there being no coach to be got, by water to Whitehall; but Gosnell not being willing to go through bridge, we were forced to land and take water, again, and put her and her sister ashore at the Temple. I am mightily pleased with her humour and singing. At Whitehall by appointment, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed carried my wife and I to the Cockpitt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1599" id="noteref-1599" epub:type="noteref">1599</a> and we had excellent places, and saw the King, Queen, Duke of Monmouth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1600" id="noteref-1600" epub:type="noteref">1600</a> his son, and my Lady Castlemaine, and all the fine ladies; and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Scornfull Lady</i>, well performed. They had done by eleven o’clock, and it being fine moonshine, we took coach and home, but could wake nobody at my house, and so were fain to have my boy get through one of the windows, and so opened the door and called up the maids, and went to supper and to bed, my mind being troubled at what my wife tells me, that her woman will not come till she hears from her mother, for I am so fond of her that I am loth now not to have her, though I know it will be a great charge to me which I ought to avoid, and so will make it up in other things. So to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-11-28" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-11-28">18th</time>. Up and to the office, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Phillip the lawyer came to me, but I put him off to the afternoon. At noon I dined at Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, Sir John Minnes being here, and he and I very kind, but I every day expect to pull a crow with him about our lodgings. My mind troubled about Gosnell and my law businesses. So after dinner to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Phillips his chamber, where he demands an abatement for Piggott’s money, which vexes me also, but I will not give it him without my father’s consent, which I will write to him tonight about, and have done it. Here meeting my uncle Thomas, he and I to my cousin Roger’s chamber, and there I did give my uncle him and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Philips to be my two arbiters against <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole and Punt, but I expect no great good of the matter. Thence walked home, and my wife came home, having been abroad today, laying out above £12 in linen, and a copper, and a pot, and bedstead, and other household stuff, which troubles me also, so that my mind tonight is very heavy and divided. Late at my office, drawing up a letter to my Lord Treasurer, which we have been long about, and so home, and, my mind troubled, to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-11-30">20th</time>. All the morning sitting at the office, at noon with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry to the Temple to advise about Field’s, but our lawyers not being in the way we went to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and there at his chamber dined, and I am still in love more and more with him for his real worth. I broke to him my desire for my wife’s brother to send him to sea as a midshipman, which he is willing to agree to, and will do it when I desire it. After dinner to the Temple, to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurland;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1601" id="noteref-1601" epub:type="noteref">1601</a> and thence to my Lord Chief Baron, Sir Edward Hale’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1602" id="noteref-1602" epub:type="noteref">1602</a> and back with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thurland to his chamber, where he told us that Field will have the better of us; and that we must study to make up the business as well as we can, which do much vex and trouble us: but I am glad the Duke is concerned in it. Thence by coach homewards, calling at a tavern in the way (being guided by the messenger in whose custody Field lies), and spoke with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith our messenger about the business, and so home, where I found that my wife had finished very neatly my study with the former hangings of the diningroom, which will upon occasion serve for a fine withdrawing room. So a little to my office and so home, and spent the evening upon my house, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-12-01">21st</time>. Within all day long, helping to put up my hangings in my house in my wife’s chamber, to my great content. In the afternoon I went to speak to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes at his lodgings, where I found many great ladies, and his lodgings made very fine indeed. At night to supper and to bed: this night having first put up a spitting sheet, which I find very convenient. This day come the King’s pleasure-boats from Calais, with the Dunkirk money, being 400,000 pistolles.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-12-02">22nd</time>. This morning, from some difference between my wife and Sarah, her maid, my wife and I fell out cruelly, to my great discontent. But I do see her set so against the wench, whom I take to be a most extraordinary good servant, that I was forced for the wench’s sake to bid her get her another place, which shall cost some trouble to my wife, however, before I suffer to be. Thence to the office, where I sat all the morning, then dined; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore with me, at home, my wife busy putting her furniture in order. Then he and I out, and he home and I to my cousin Roger Pepys to advise about treating with my uncle Thomas, and thence called at the Wardrobe on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore again, and so home, and after doing much business at my office I went home and caused a new fashion knocker to be put on my door, and did other things to the putting my house in order, and getting my outward door painted, and the arch. This day I bought the book of country dances against my wife’s woman Gosnell comes, who dances finely; and there meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Playford he did give me his Latin songs of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deering’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1603" id="noteref-1603" epub:type="noteref">1603</a> which he lately printed. This day <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore told me that for certain the Queen-Mother is married to my Lord <abbr>St.</abbr> Albans, and he is like to be made Lord Treasurer. News that Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Lawson hath made up a peace now with Tunis and Tripoli, as well as Argiers, by which he will come home very highly honoured.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-12-03">23rd (Lord’s day)</time>. Up, after some talk with my wife, soberly, upon yesterday’s difference, and made good friends, and to church to hear <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills, and so home, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore and my brother Tom dined with me. My wife not being well today did not rise. In the afternoon to church again, and heard drowsy <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Graves, and so to see Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who continues ill in bed, but grows better and better every day. Thence to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, and there stayed awhile and heard how Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford’s daughter is married to a fellow without friends’ consent, and the match carried on and made up at Will Griffin’s, our doorkeeper’s. So to my office and did a little business, and so home and to bed. I talked to my brother today, who desires me to give him leave to look after his mistress still; and he will not have me put to any trouble or obligation in it, which I did give him leave to do. I hear today how old rich Audley<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1604" id="noteref-1604" epub:type="noteref">1604</a> is lately dead, and left a very great estate, and made a great many poor familys rich, not all to one. Among others, one Davis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1605" id="noteref-1605" epub:type="noteref">1605</a> my old schoolfellow at Paul’s, and since a bookseller in Paul’s Church Yard: and it seems do forgive one man £60,000 which he had wronged him of, but names not his name; but it is well known to be the scrivener in Fleet Street, at whose house he lodged. There is also this week dead a poulterer, in Gracious Street,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1606" id="noteref-1606" epub:type="noteref">1606</a> which was thought rich, but not so rich, that hath left £800 per annum, taken in other men’s names, and 40,000 Jacobs in gold.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1607" id="noteref-1607" epub:type="noteref">1607</a></p>

Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten, and I, going forth toward Whitehall, we hear that the King and Duke are come this morning to the Tower to see the Dunkirk money.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1608" id="noteref-1608" epub:type="noteref">1608</a> So we by coach to them, and there went up and down all the magazines with them; but methought it was but poor discourse and frothy that the King’s companions (young Killigrew among the rest) about the codpieces of some of the men in armour there to be seen, had with him. We saw none of the money, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Slingsby<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1609" id="noteref-1609" epub:type="noteref">1609</a> did show the King, and I did see, the stamps of the new money that is now to be made by Blondeau’s fashion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1610" id="noteref-1610" epub:type="noteref">1610</a> which are very neat, and like the King. Thence the King to Woolwich, though a very cold day; and the Duke to Whitehall, commanding us to come after him, which we did by coach; and in his closet, my Lord Sandwich being there, did discourse with us about getting some of this money to pay off the Fleets, and other matters; and then away hence, and, it being almost dinner time, I to my Lord Crew’s, and dined with him, and had very good discourse, and he seemed to be much pleased with my visits. Thence to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Phillips, and so to the Temple, where met my cousin Roger Pepys and his brother, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John, as my arbitrators against <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Bernard for my uncle Thomas, and we two with them by appointment. They began very high in their demands, and my friends, partly being not so well acquainted with the will, and partly, I doubt, not being so good wits as they, for which I blame my choosing of relations (who besides that are equally engaged to stand for them as me), I was much troubled thereat, and taking occasion to deny without my father’s consent to bind myself in a bond of £2,000 to stand to their award, I broke off the business for the present till I hear and consider further, and so thence by coach (my cousin, Thomas Pepys, being in another chamber busy all the while, going along with me) homeward, and I set him down by the way; but, Lord! how he did endeavour to find out a ninepence to clubb with me for the coach, and for want was forced to give me a shilling, and how he still cries “Gad!” and talks of Popery coming in, as all the Fanatiques do, of which I was ashamed. So home, finding my poor wife very busy putting things in order, and so to bed, my mind being very much troubled, and could hardly sleep all night, thinking how things are like to go with us about Brampton, and blaming myself for living so high as I do when for ought I know my father and mother may come to live upon my hands when all is done.</p>

Up and to the office all the morning, and at noon with the rest, by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Holy, the ironmonger’s invitation, to the Dolphin, to a venison pasty, very good, and rare at this time of the year, and thence by coach with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry as far as the Temple, and thence to Greatorex’s, where I stayed and talked with him, and got him to mend my pocket ruler for me, and so by coach to my Lord’s lodging, where I sat with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore by appointment, making up accounts for my Lord Sandwich, which done he and I and <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Ferrers and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Howe very merry a good while in the great dining room, and so it being late and my Lord not coming in, I by coach to the Temple, and thence walked home, and so to my study to do some business, and then home and to bed. Great talk among people how some of the Fanatiques do say that the end of the world is at hand, and that next Tuesday is to be the day. Against which, whenever it shall be, good God fit us all.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-12-06">26th</time>. In the morning to the Temple to my cousin Roger, who now desires that I would excuse him from arbitrating, he not being able to stand for me as he would do, without appearing too high against my uncle Thomas, which will raise his clamour. With this I am very well pleased, for I did desire it, and so I shall choose other counsel. Thence home, he being busy that I could not speak more with him. All day long till twelve o’clock at night getting my house in order, my wife putting up the red hangings and bed in her woman’s chamber, and I my books and all other matters in my chamber and study, which is now very pretty. So to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-12-7" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-12-07">27th</time>. At my waking, I found the tops of the houses covered with snow, which is a rare sight, that I have not seen these three years. Up, and put my people to perfect the cleaning of my house, and so to the office, where we sat till noon; and then we all went to the next house upon Tower Hill, to see the coming by of the Russia Embassador; for whose reception all the City trained-bands do attend in the streets, and the King’s life-guards, and most of the wealthy citizens in their black velvet coats, and gold chains (which remain of their gallantry at the King’s coming in), but they stayed so long that we went down again home to dinner. And after I had dined, I heard they were coming, and so I walked to the Conduit in the Quarrefowr,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1611" id="noteref-1611" epub:type="noteref">1611</a> at the end of Gracious-street and Cornhill; and there (the spouts thereof running very near me upon all the people that were under it) I saw them pretty well go by. I could not see the Embassador in his coach; but his attendants in their habits and fur caps very handsome, comely men, and most of them with hawkes upon their fists to present to the King. But Lord! to see the absurd nature of Englishmen, that cannot forbear laughing and jeering at everything that looks strange. So back and to the office, and there we met and sat till seven o’clock, making a bargain with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wood for his masts of New England; and then in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry’s coach to the Temple, but my cousin Roger Pepys not being at leisure to speak to me about my business, I presently walked home, and to my office till very late doing business, and so home, where I found my house more and more clear and in order, and hope in a day or two now to be in very good condition there and to my full content. Which God grant! So to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1662-12-08">28th</time>. A very hard frost; which is news to us after having none almost these three years. Up and to Ironmongers’ Hall<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1612" id="noteref-1612" epub:type="noteref">1612</a> by ten o’clock to the funeral of Sir Richard Stayner.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1613" id="noteref-1613" epub:type="noteref">1613</a> Here we were, all the officers of the Navy, and my Lord Sandwich, who did discourse with us about the fishery, telling us of his Majesty’s resolution to give £200 to every man that will set out a Busse;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1614" id="noteref-1614" epub:type="noteref">1614</a> and advising about the effects of this encouragement, which will be a very great matter certainly. Here we had good rings, and by and by were to take coach; and I being got in with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed into a four-horse coach, which they come and told us were only for the mourners, I went out, and so took this occasion to go home. Where I stayed all day expecting Gosnell’s coming, but there came an excuse from her that she had not heard yet from her mother, but that she will come next week, which I wish she may, since I must keep one that I may have some pleasure therein. So to my office till late writing out a copy of my uncle’s will, and so home and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-12-9" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-12-09">29th</time>. Before I went to the office my wife’s brother did come to us, and we did instruct him to go to Gosnell’s and to see what the true matter is of her not coming, and whether she do intend to come or no, and so I to the office; and this morning come Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret to us (being the first time we have seen him since his coming from France): he tells us, that the silver which he received for Dunkirk did weigh 120,000 weight. Here all the morning upon business, and at noon (not going home to dinner, though word was brought me that <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Will.</abbr> Joyce was there, whom I had not seen at my house nor anywhere else these three or four months) with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry by his coach as far as Fleet Street, and there stepped into Madam Turner’s, where was told I should find my cousin Roger Pepys, and with him to the Temple, but not having time to do anything I went towards my Lord Sandwich’s. (In my way went into <abbr>Captn.</abbr> Cuttance’s coach, and with him to my Lord’s.) But the company not being ready I did slip down to Wilkinson’s, and having not eat anything today did eat a mutton pie and drank, and so to my Lord’s, where my Lord and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Darcy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1615" id="noteref-1615" epub:type="noteref">1615</a> one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Parham (a very knowing and well-spoken man in this business), with several others, did meet about stating the business of the fishery, and the manner of the King’s giving of this £200 to every man that shall set out a new-made English Busse by the middle of June next. In which business we had many fine pretty discourses; and I did here see the great pleasure to be had in discoursing of publique matters with men that are particularly acquainted with this or that business. Having come to some issue, wherein a motion of mine was well received, about sending these invitations from the King to all the fishing-ports in general, with limiting so many Busses to this, and that port, before we know the readiness of subscribers, we parted, and I walked home all the way, and having wrote a letter full of business to my father, in my way calling upon my cousin Turner and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Calthrop at the Temple, for their consent to be my arbitrators, which they are willing to. My wife and I to bed pretty pleasant, for that her brother brings word that Gosnell, which my wife and I in discourse do pleasantly call our Marmotte, will certainly come next week without fail, which God grant may be for the best.</p>

			<article id="entry-1662-12-10" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1662-12-10">30th (Lord’s day)</time>. To church in the morning, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills made a pretty good sermon. It is a bitter cold frost today. Dined alone with my wife today with great content, my house being quite clean from top to bottom. In the afternoon I to the French church here<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1616" id="noteref-1616" epub:type="noteref">1616</a> in the city, and stood in the aisle all the sermon, with great delight hearing a very admirable sermon, from a very young man, upon the article in our creed, in order of catechism, upon the Resurrection. Thence home, and to visit Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who continues still bed-rid. Here was Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batten and his Lady, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and I very merry, talking of the confidence of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Ford’s new-married daughter, though she married so strangely lately, yet appears at church as brisk as can be, and takes place of her elder sister, a maid. Thence home and to supper, and then, cold as it is, to my office, to make up my monthly accounts, and I do find that, through the fitting of my house this month, I have spent in that and kitchen £50 this month; so that now I am worth but £660, or thereabouts. This being done and fitted myself for the Duke tomorrow, I went home, and to prayers and to bed. This day I first did wear a muffe, being my wife’s last year’s muffe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1617" id="noteref-1617" epub:type="noteref">1617</a> and now I have bought her a new one, this serves me very well. Thus ends this month; in great frost; myself and family all well, but my mind much disordered about my uncle’s law business, being now in an order of being arbitrated between us, which I wish to God it were done. I am also somewhat uncertain what to think of my going about to take a woman-servant into my house, in the quality of a woman for my wife. My wife promises it shall cost me nothing but her meat and wages, and that it shall not be attended with any other expenses, upon which termes I admit of it; for that it will, I hope, save me money in having my wife go abroad on visits and other delights; so that I hope the best, but am resolved to alter it, if matters prove otherwise than I would have them. Publique matters in an ill condition of discontent against the height and vanity of the Court, and their bad payments: but that which troubles most, is the Clergy, which will never content the City, which is not to be reconciled to Bishopps: the more the pity that differences must still be. Dunkirk newly sold, and the money brought over; of which we hope to get some to pay the Navy: which by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Lawson’s having dispatched the business in the Straights, by making peace with Argier,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1618" id="noteref-1618" epub:type="noteref">1618</a> Tunis, and Tripoli (and so his fleet will also shortly come home), will now every day grow less, and so the King’s charge be abated; which God send!</p>
