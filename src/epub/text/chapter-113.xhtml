				<p><time datetime="1669-05-11">May 1st</time>. Up betimes. Called up by my tailor, and there first put on a summer suit this year; but it was not my fine one of flowered tabby vest, and coloured camlet tunic, because it was too fine with the gold lace at the hands, that I was afeard to be seen in it; but put on the stuff suit I made the last year, which is now repaired; and so did go to the Office in it, and sat all the morning, the day looking as if it would be fowle. At noon home to dinner, and there find my wife extraordinary fine, with her flowered tabby gown that she made two years ago, now laced exceeding pretty; and, indeed, was fine all over; and mighty earnest to go, though the day was very lowering; and she would have me put on my fine suit, which I did. And so anon we went alone through the town with our new liveries of serge, and the horses’ manes and tails tied with red ribbons, and the standards there gilt with varnish, and all clean, and green refines, that people did mightily look upon us; and, the truth is, I did not see any coach more pretty, though more gay, than ours, all the day. But we set out, out of humour⁠—I because Betty, whom I expected, was not come to go with us; and my wife that I would sit on the same seat with her, which she likes not, being so fine: and she then expected to meet Sheres, which we did in the Pell Mell, and, against my will, I was forced to take him into the coach, but was sullen all day almost, and little complaisant: the day also being unpleasing, though the Park full of coaches, but dusty and windy, and cold, and now and then a little dribbling rain; and, what made it worst, there were so many hackney-coaches as spoiled the sight of the gentlemen’s; and so we had little pleasure. But here was <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batelier and his sister in a borrowed coach by themselves, and I took them and we to the lodge; and at the door did give them a syllabub, and other things, cost me 12<abbr>s.</abbr>, and pretty merry. And so back to the coaches, and there till the evening, and then home, leaving <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sheres<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4510" id="noteref-4510" epub:type="noteref">4510</a> at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s Gate, where he took leave of us for altogether, he being this night to set out for Portsmouth post, in his way to Tangier, which troubled my wife mightily, who is mighty, though not, I think, too fond of him. But she was out of humour all the evening, and I vexed at her for it, and she did not rest almost all the night, so as in the night I was forced to take her and hug her to put her to rest. So home, and after a little supper, to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-12">2nd (Lord’s day)</time>. Up, and by water to Whitehall, and there visit my Lord Sandwich, who, after about two months’ absence at Hinchingbroke, come to town last night. I saw him, and very kind; and I am glad he is so, I having not wrote to him all the time, my eyes indeed not letting me. Here with Sir Charles Herbert [Harbord], and my Lord Hinchingbroke, and Sidney, we looked upon the picture of Tangier, designed by Charles Herbert [Harbord],<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4511" id="noteref-4511" epub:type="noteref">4511</a> and drawn by Dancre, which my Lord Sandwich admires, as being the truest picture that ever he’s saw in his life: and it is indeed very pretty, and I will be at the cost of having one of them. Thence with them to Whitehall, and there walked out the sermon, with one or other; and then saw the Duke of York after sermon, and he talked to me a little; and so away back by water home, and after dinner got my wife to read, and then by coach, she and I, to the Park, and there spent the evening with much pleasure, it proving clear after a little shower, and we mighty fine as yesterday, and people mightily pleased with our coach, as I perceived; but I had not on my fine suit, being really afeard to wear it, it being so fine with the gold lace, though not gay. So home and to supper, and my wife to read, and Tom, my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Nepotisme</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4512" id="noteref-4512" epub:type="noteref">4512</a> and then to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-13">3rd</time>. Up, and by coach to my Lord Brouncker’s, where Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret did meet Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes and me, to discourse upon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deering’s business, who was directed, in the time of the war, to provide provisions at Hamburg, by Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s direction; and now <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret is afeard to own it, it being done without written order. But by our meeting we do all begin to recollect enough to preserve <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deering, I think, which, poor silly man! I shall be glad of, it being too much he should suffer for endeavouring to serve us. Thence to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, where the Duke of York was playing in the Pell Mell; and so he called me to him most part of the time that he played, which was an hour, and talked alone to me; and, among other things, tells me how the King will not yet be got to name anybody in the room of Penn, but puts it off for three or four days; from whence he do collect that they are brewing something for the Navy, but what he knows not; but I perceive is vexed that things should go so, and he hath reason; for he told me that it is likely they will do in this as in other things⁠—resolve first, and consider it and the fitness of it afterward. Thence to Whitehall, and met with Creed, and I took him to the Harp and Balls, and there drank a cup of ale, he and I alone, and discoursed of matters; and I perceive by him that he makes no doubt but that all will turn to the old religion, for these people cannot hold things in their hands, nor prevent its coming to that; and by his discourse fits himself for it, and would have my Lord Sandwich do so, too, and me. After a little talk with him, and particularly about the ruinous condition of Tangier, which I have a great mind to lay before the Duke of York, before it be too late, but dare not, because of his great kindness to Lord Middleton, we parted, and I homeward; but called at Povy’s, and there he stopped me to dinner, there being <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Williamson, the Lieutenant of the Tower,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4513" id="noteref-4513" epub:type="noteref">4513</a> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Childe, and several others. And after dinner, Povy and I together to talk of Tangier; and he would have me move the Duke of York in it, for it concerns him particularly, more than any, as being the head of us; and I do think to do it. Thence home, and at the office busy all the afternoon, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-14">4th</time>. Up, and to the office, and then my wife being gone to see her mother at Deptford, I before the office sat went to the Excise Office, and thence being alone stepped into Duck Lane, and thence tried to have sent a porter to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>’s, but durst not trust him, and therefore having bought a book to satisfy the bookseller for my stay there, a 12<abbr>d.</abbr> book, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Andronicus</i> of Tom Fuller,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4514" id="noteref-4514" epub:type="noteref">4514</a> I took coach, and at the end of Jewen Street next Red Cross Street I sent the coachman to her lodging, and understand she is gone for Greenwich to one Marys’s, a tanner’s, at which I was glad, hoping to have opportunity to find her out; and so, in great fear of being seen, I to the office, and there all the morning, dined at home, and presently after dinner comes home my wife, who I believe is jealous of my spending the day, and I had very good fortune in being at home, for if <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> had been to have been found it is forty to one but I had been abroad, God forgive me. So the afternoon at the office, and at night walked with my wife in the garden, and my Lord Brouncker with us, who is newly come to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn’s lodgings; and by and by comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hooke; and my Lord, and he, and I into my Lord’s lodgings, and there discoursed of many fine things in philosophy, to my great content, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1669-5-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-15">5th</time>. Up, and thought to have gone with Lord Brouncker to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hooke this morning betimes; but my Lord is taken ill of the gout, and says his new lodgings have infected him, he never having had any symptoms of it till now. So walked to Gresham College, to tell Hooke that my Lord could not come; and so left word, he being abroad, and I to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and thence, with the Duke of York, to Whitehall, where the Board waited on him all the morning: and so at noon with Sir Thomas Allen, and Sir Edward Scott,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4515" id="noteref-4515" epub:type="noteref">4515</a> and Lord Carlingford,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4516" id="noteref-4516" epub:type="noteref">4516</a> to the Spanish Embassador’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4517" id="noteref-4517" epub:type="noteref">4517</a> where I dined the first time. The Olio not so good as Sheres’s. There was at the table himself and a Spanish Countess, a good, comely, and witty lady⁠—three Fathers and us. Discourse good and pleasant. And here was an Oxford scholar in a Doctor of Law’s gown, sent from the College where the Embassador lay, when the Court was there, to salute him before his return to Spain: This man, though a gentle sort of scholar, yet sat like a fool for want of French or Spanish, but [knew] only Latin, which he spoke like an Englishman to one of the Fathers. And by and by he and I to talk, and the company very merry at my defending Cambridge against Oxford: and I made much use of my French and Spanish here, to my great content. But the dinner not extraordinary at all, either for quantity or quality. Thence home, where my wife ill of those upon the maid’s bed, and troubled at my being abroad. So I to the office, and there till night, and then to her, and she read to me the Epistle of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cassandra</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4518" id="noteref-4518" epub:type="noteref">4518</a> which is very good indeed; and the better to her, because recommended by Sheres. So to supper, and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-16">6th</time>. Up, and by coach to Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s, but he gone out. I by water back to the Office, and there all the morning; then to dinner, and then to the Office again, and anon with my wife by coach to take the air, it being a noble day, as far as the Greene Man,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4519" id="noteref-4519" epub:type="noteref">4519</a> mightily pleased with our journey, and our condition of doing it in our own coach, and so home, and to walk in the garden, and so to supper and to bed, my eyes being bad with writing my journal, part of it, tonight.</p>

			<article id="entry-1669-5-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-17">7th</time>. Up, and by coach to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry’s; and there to talk with him a great deal with great content; and so to the Duke of York, having a great mind to speak to him about Tangier; but, when I come to it, his interest for my Lord Middleton is such that I dare not. So to the Treasury chamber, and then walked home round by the Excise Office, having by private vows last night in prayer to God Almighty cleared my mind for the present of the thoughts of going to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> at Greenwich, which I did long after. I passed by Guildhall, which is almost finished, and saw a poor labourer carried by, I think, dead with a fall, as many there are, I hear. So home to dinner, and then to the office a little, and so to see my Lord Brouncker, who is a little ill of the gout; and there Madam Williams told me that she heard that my wife was going into France this year, which I did not deny, if I can get time, and I pray God I may. But I wondering how she come to know it, she tells me a woman that my wife spoke to for a maid, did tell her so, and that a lady that desires to go thither would be glad to go in her company. Thence with my wife abroad, with our coach, most pleasant weather; and to Hackney, and into the marshes, where I never was before, and thence round about to Old Ford and Bow; and coming through the latter home, there being some young gentlewomen at a door, and I seeming not to know who they were, my wife’s jealousy told me presently that I knew well enough it was that damned place where <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> dwelt, which made me swear very angrily that it was false, as it was, and I carried [her] back again to see the place, and it proved not so, so I continued out of humour a good while at it, she being willing to be friends, so I was by and by, saying no more of it. So home, and there met with a letter from Captain Silas Taylor, and, with it, his written copy of a play that he hath wrote, and intends to have acted. It is called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Serenade, or Disappointment</i>, which I will read, not believing he can make any good of that kind. He did once offer to show Harris it, but Harris told him that he would judge by one Act whether it were good or no, which is indeed a foolish saying, and we see them out themselves in the choice of a play after they have read the whole, it being sometimes found not fit to act above three times; nay, and some that have been refused at one house is found a good one at the other. This made Taylor say he would not show it him, but is angry, and hath carried it to the other house, and he thinks it will be acted there, though he tells me they are not yet agreed upon it. But I will find time to get it read to me, and I did get my wife to begin a little tonight in the garden, but not so much as I could make any judgment of it. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1669-5-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-18">8th</time>. Up, and to the Office, and there comes Lead to me, and at last my vizards are done, and glasses got to put in and out, as I will; and I think I have brought it to the utmost, both for easiness of using and benefit, that I can; and so I paid him 15<abbr>s.</abbr> for what he hath done now last, in the finishing them, and they, I hope, will do me a great deal of ease. At the Office all the morning, and this day, the first time, did alter my side of the table, after above eight years sitting on that next the fire. But now I am not able to bear the light of the windows in my eyes, I do begin there, and I did sit with much more content than I had done on the other side for a great while, and in winter the fire will not trouble my back. At noon home to dinner, and after dinner all the afternoon within, with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hater, Gibson, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer, reading over and drawing up new things in the Instructions of Commanders, which will be good, and I hope to get them confirmed by the Duke of York, though I perceive nothing will effectually perfect them but to look over the whole body of the Instructions, of all the Officers of a ship, and make them all perfect together. This being done, comes my bookseller, and brings me home bound my collection of papers, about my Address to the Duke of York in August, which makes me glad, it being that which shall do me more right many years hence than, perhaps, all I ever did in my life: and therefore I do, both for my own and the King’s sake, value it much. By and by also comes Browne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4520" id="noteref-4520" epub:type="noteref">4520</a> the mathematical instrument maker, and brings me home my instrument for perspective, made according to the description of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Wren’s, in the late <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Transactions</i>; and he hath made it, I think, very well, and that, that I believe will do the thing, and therein gives me great content; but have I fear all the content that must be received by my eyes is almost lost. So to the office, and there late at business, and then home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1669-5-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-19">9th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up; and, after dressing in my best suit with gold trimming, I to the Office, and there with Gibson and Tom finishing against tomorrow my notes upon Commanders’ Instructions; and, when church-time, to church with my wife, leaving them at work. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mills preached a dull sermon, and so we home to dinner; and thence by coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> Andrew’s, Holborne, thinking to have heard <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Stillingfleete preach, but we could not get a place, and so to <abbr>St.</abbr> Margaret’s, Westminster, and there heard a sermon, and did get a place, the first we have heard there these many years, and here at a distance I saw Betty Michell, but she is become much a plainer woman than she was a girl. Thence towards the Park, but too soon to go in, so went on to Knightsbridge, and there eat and drank at “The World’s End,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4521" id="noteref-4521" epub:type="noteref">4521</a> where we had good things, and then back to the Park, and there till night, being fine weather, and much company, and so home, and after supper to bed. This day I first left off both my waistcoats by day, and my waistcoat by night, it being very hot weather, so hot as to make me break out, here and there, in my hands, which vexes me to see, but is good for me.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1669-5-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-20">10th</time>. Troubled, about three in the morning, with my wife’s calling her maid up, and rising herself, to go with her coach abroad, to gather May-dew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4522" id="noteref-4522" epub:type="noteref">4522</a> which she did, and I troubled for it, for fear of any hurt, going abroad so betimes, happening to her; but I to sleep again, and she come home about six, and to bed again all well, and I up and with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gibson by coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and thence to Whitehall, where the Duke of York met the Office, and there discoursed of several things, particularly the Instructions of Commanders of ships. But here happened by chance a discourse of the Council of Trade, against which the Duke of York is mightily displeased, and particularly <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Child, against whom he speaking hardly, Captain Cox did second the Duke of York, by saying that he was talked of for an unfair dealer with masters of ships, about freight: to which Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Littleton very hotly and foolishly replied presently, that he never heard any honest man speak ill of Child; to which the Duke of York did make a smart reply, and was angry; so as I was sorry to hear it come so far, and that I, by seeming to assent to Cox, might be observed too much by Littleton, though I said nothing aloud, for this must breed great heartburnings. After this meeting done, the Duke of York took the Treasurers into his closet to chide them, as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wren tells me; for that my Lord Keeper did last night at the Council say, when nobody was ready to say anything against the constitution of the Navy, that he did believe the Treasurers of the Navy had something to say, which was very foul on their part, to be parties against us. They being gone, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wren [and I] took boat, thinking to dine with my Lord of Canterbury;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4523" id="noteref-4523" epub:type="noteref">4523</a> but, when we come to Lambeth, the gate was shut, which is strictly done at twelve o’clock, and nobody comes in afterwards: so we lost our labour, and therefore back to Whitehall, and thence walked my boy Jacke with me, to my Lord Crew, whom I have not seen since he was sick, which is eight months ago, I think, and there dined with him: he is mightily broke. A stranger a country gentleman, was with him: and he pleased with my discourse accidentally about the decay of gentlemen’s families in the country, telling us that the old rule was, that a family might remain fifty miles from London one hundred years, one hundred miles from London two hundred years, and so farther, or nearer London more or less years. He also told us that he hath heard his father say, that in his time it was so rare for a country gentleman to come to London, that, when he did come, he used to make his will before he set out. Thence to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and there met the Duke of York, who told me, with great content, that he did now think he should master our adversaries, for that the King did tell him that he was satisfied in the constitution of the Navy, but that it was well to give these people leave to object against it, which they having not done, he did give order to give warrant to the Duke of York to direct Sir Jeremy Smith<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4524" id="noteref-4524" epub:type="noteref">4524</a> to be a Commissioner of the Navy in the room of Penn; which, though he be an impertinent fellow, yet I am glad of it, it showing that the other side is not so strong as it was: and so, in plain terms, the Duke of York did tell me, that they were every day losing ground; and particularly that he would take care to keep out Child: at all which I am glad, though yet I dare not think myself secure, as the King may yet be wrought upon by these people to bring changes in our Office, and remove us, ere it be long. Thence I to Whitehall, and there took boat to Westminster, and to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, who is not come to town from her husband at Portsmouth. So drank only at Cragg’s with Doll, and so to the Swan, and there <i xml:lang="fr">baiser</i> a new maid that is there, and so to Whitehall again, to a Committee of Tangier, where I see all things going to rack in the business of the Corporation, and consequently in the place, by Middleton’s going. Thence walked a little with Creed, who tells me he hears how fine my horses and coach are, and advises me to avoid being noted for it, which I was vexed to hear taken notice of, it being what I feared and Povy told me of my gold-lace sleeves in the Park yesterday, which vexed me also, so as to resolve never to appear in Court with them, but presently to have them taken off, as it is fit I should, and so to my wife at Unthanke’s, and coach, and so called at my tailor’s to that purpose, and so home, and after a little walk in the garden, home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1669-5-21" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-21">11th</time>. My wife again up by four o’clock, to go to gather May-dew; and so back home by seven, to bed, and by and by I up and to the office, where all the morning, and dined at noon at home with my people, and so all the afternoon. In the evening my wife and I all alone, with the boy, by water, up as high as Putney almost, with the tide, and back again, neither staying going nor coming; but talking, and singing, and reading a foolish copy of verses upon my Lord Mayor’s entertaining of all the bachelors, designed in praise to my Lord Mayor, and so home and to the office a little, and then home to bed, my eyes being bad. Some trouble at Court for fear of the Queen’s miscarrying; she being, as they all conclude, far gone with child.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-22">12th</time>. Up, and to Westminster Hall, where the term is, and this the first day of my being there, and here by chance met Roger Pepys, come to town the last night: I was glad to see him. After some talk with him and others, and among others Sir Charles Harbord and Sidney Montagu, the latter of whom is to set out tomorrow towards Flanders and Italy, I invited them to dine with me tomorrow, and so to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s lodging, who come to town last night, and there <i xml:lang="fr">je</i> did <i xml:lang="fr">hazer</i> her, she having been a month, I think, at Portsmouth with her husband, newly come home from the Streights. But, Lord! how silly the woman talks of her great entertainment there, and how all the gentry come to visit her, and that she believes her husband is worth £6 or £700, which nevertheless I am glad of, but I doubt they will spend it a fast. Thence home, and after dinner my wife and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there, in the side balcony, over against the music, did hear, but not see, a new play, the first day acted, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Roman Virgin</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4525" id="noteref-4525" epub:type="noteref">4525</a> an old play, and but ordinary, I thought; but the trouble of my eyes with the light of the candles did almost kill me. Thence to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there had a promise from Sidney to come and dine with me tomorrow; and so my wife and I home in our coach, and there find my brother John, as I looked for, come to town from Ellington,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4526" id="noteref-4526" epub:type="noteref">4526</a> where, among other things, he tell me the first news that my [sister Jackson] is with child, and fat gone, which I know not whether it did more trouble or please me, having no great care for my friends to have children; though I love other people’s. So, glad to see him, we to supper, and so to bed.</p>

Up, and to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s to the Duke of York, and thence to Whitehall, where we met about office business, and then at noon with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wren to Lambeth, to dinner with the Archbishop of Canterbury; the first time I was ever there and I have long longed for it; where a noble house, and well furnished with good pictures and furniture, and noble attendance in good order, and great deal of company, though an ordinary day; and exceeding great cheer, nowhere better, or so much, that ever I think I saw, for an ordinary table: and the Bishop mighty kind to me, particularly desiring my company another time, when less company there. Most of the company gone, and I going, I heard by a gentleman of a sermon that was to be there; and so I stayed to hear it, thinking it serious, till by and by the gentleman told me it was a mockery, by one Cornet Bolton, a very gentleman-like man, that behind a chair did pray and preach like a Presbyter Scot that ever I heard in my life, with all the possible imitation in grimaces and voice. And his text about the hanging up their harps upon the willows:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4527" id="noteref-4527" epub:type="noteref">4527</a> and a serious good sermon too, exclaiming against Bishops, and crying up of my good Lord Eglinton,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4528" id="noteref-4528" epub:type="noteref">4528</a> till it made us all burst; but I did wonder to have the Bishop at this time to make himself sport with things of this kind, but I perceive it was shown him as a rarity; and he took care to have the room-door shut, but there were about twenty gentlemen there, and myself, infinitely pleased with the novelty. So over to Whitehall, to a little Committee of Tangier; and thence walking in the Gallery, I met Sir Thomas Osborne, who, to my great content, did of his own accord fall into discourse with me, with so much professions of value and respect, placing the whole virtue of the Office of the Navy upon me, and that for the Comptroller’s place, no man in England was fit for it but me, when Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, as he says it is necessary, is removed: but then he knows not what to do for a man in my place; and in discourse, though I have no mind to the other, I did bring in Tom Hater to be the fittest man in the world for it, which he took good notice of. But in the whole I was mightily pleased, reckoning myself now fifty percent securer in my place than I did before think myself to be. Thence to Unthanke’s, and there find my wife, but not dressed, which vexed me, because going to the Park, it being a most pleasant day after yesterday’s rain, which lays all the dust, and most people going out thither, which vexed me. So home, sullen; but then my wife and I by water, with my brother, as high as Fulham, talking and singing, and playing the rogue with the Western bargemen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4529" id="noteref-4529" epub:type="noteref">4529</a> about the women of Woolwich,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4530" id="noteref-4530" epub:type="noteref">4530</a> which mads them, and so back home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-25">15th</time>. Up, and at the Office all the morning. Dined at home and Creed with me home, and I did discourse about evening some reckonings with him in the afternoon; but I could not, for my eyes, do it, which troubled me, and vexed him that would not; but yet we were friends, I advancing him more without it, and so to walk all the afternoon together in the garden; and I perceive still he do expect a change in of matters, especially as to religion, and fits himself for it by professing himself for it in his discourse.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4531" id="noteref-4531" epub:type="noteref">4531</a> He gone, I to my business at my Office, and so at night home to supper, and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-26">16th (Lord’s day)</time>. My wife and I at church, our pew filled with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Backewell, and six more that she brought with her, which vexed me at her confidence. Dined at home and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batelier with us, and I all the afternoon drawing up a foul draught of my petition to the Duke of York, about my eyes, for leave to spend three or four months out of the Office, drawing it so as to give occasion to a voyage abroad which I did, to my pretty good liking; and then with my wife to Hyde Park, where a good deal of company, and good weather, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1669-05-27">17th</time>. Up, and to several places doing business, and then home to dinner, and then my wife and I and brother John by coach to the King’s playhouse, and saw <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Spanish Curate</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4532" id="noteref-4532" epub:type="noteref">4532</a> revived, which is a pretty good play, but my eyes troubled with seeing it, mightily. Thence carried them and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gibson, who met me at my Lord Brouncker’s with a fair copy of my petition, which I thought to show the Duke of York this night, but could not, and therefore carried them to the Park, where they had never been, and so home to supper and to bed. Great the news now of the French taking <abbr>St.</abbr> Domingo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4533" id="noteref-4533" epub:type="noteref">4533</a> in Spaniola, from the Spaniards, which troubles us, that they should have it, and have the honour of taking it, when we could not.</p>

At noon home and dined in my wife’s chamber, she being much troubled with the tooth-ache, and I stayed till a surgeon of hers come, one Leeson, who hath formerly drawn her mouth, and he advised her to draw it: so I to the Office, and by and by word is come that she hath drawn it, which pleased me, it being well done. So I home, to comfort her, and so back to the office till night, busy, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1669-5-29" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1669-05-29">19th</time>. With my coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s; and there finding the Duke of York gone to muster his men, in Hyde Park, I alone with my boy thither, and there saw more, walking out of my coach as other gentlemen did, of a soldier’s trade, than ever I did in my life: the men being mighty fine, and their Commanders, particularly the Duke of Monmouth; but methought their trade but very easy as to the mustering of their men, and the men but indifferently ready to perform what was commanded, in the handling of their arms. Here the news was first talked of Harry Killigrew’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4534" id="noteref-4534" epub:type="noteref">4534</a> being wounded in nine places last night, by footmen, in the highway, going from the Park in a hackney-coach towards Hammersmith, to his house at Turnham Greene: they being supposed to be my Lady Shrewsbury’s men, she being by, in her coach with six horses; upon an old grudge of his saying openly that he had lain with her. Thence by and by to Whitehall, and there I waited upon the King and Queen all dinnertime, in the Queen’s lodgings, she being in her white pinner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4535" id="noteref-4535" epub:type="noteref">4535</a> and apron, like a woman with child; and she seemed handsomer plain so, than dressed. And by and by, dinner done, I out, and to walk in the Gallery, for the Duke of York’s coming out; and there, meeting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> May, he took me down about four o’clock to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chevins’s lodgings, and all alone did get me a dish of cold chickens, and good wine; and I dined like a prince, being before very hungry and empty. By and by the Duke of York comes, and readily took me to his closet, and received my petition, and discoursed about my eyes, and pitied me, and with much kindness did give me his consent to be absent, and approved of my proposition to go into Holland to observe things there, of the Navy; but would first ask the King’s leave, which he anon did, and did tell me that the King would be a good master to me, these were his words, about my eyes, and do like of my going into Holland, but do advise that nobody should know of my going thither, but pretend that I did go into the country somewhere, which I liked well. Glad of this, I home, and thence took out my wife, and to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Holliard’s about a swelling in her cheek, but he not at home, and so round by Islington and eat and drink, and so home, and after supper to bed. In discourse this afternoon, the Duke of York did tell me that he was the most amazed at one thing just now, that ever he was in his life, which was, that the Duke of Buckingham did just now come into the Queen’s bedchamber, where the King was, and much mixed company, and among others, Tom Killigrew, the father of Harry, who was last night wounded so as to be in danger of death, and his man is quite dead; and [Buckingham] there in discourse did say that he had spoke with someone that was by (which all the world must know that it must be his whore, my Lady Shrewsbury), who says that they did not mean to hurt, but beat him, and that he did run first at them with his sword; so that he do hereby clearly discover that he knows who did it, and is of conspiracy with them, being of known conspiracy with her, which the Duke of York did seem to be pleased with, and said it might, perhaps, cost him his life in the House of Lords; and I find was mightily pleased with it, saying it was the most impudent thing, as well as the most foolish, that ever he knew man do in all his life.</p>

Yesterday, at my coming home, I found that my wife had, on a sudden, put away Matt upon some falling out, and I doubt my wife did call her ill names by my wife’s own discourse; but I did not meddle to say anything upon it, but let her go, being not sorry, because now we may get one that speaks French, to go abroad with us.</p>

The Court full of the news from Captain Hubbert, of <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">The Milford</i>, touching his being affronted in the Streights, shot at, and having eight men killed him by a French man-of-war, calling him “English dog,” and commanding him to strike, which he refused, and, as knowing himself much too weak for him, made away from him. The Queen, as being supposed with child, fell ill, so as to call for Madam Nun, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chevins’s sister, and one of her women, from dinner from us; this being the last day of their doubtfulness touching her being with child; and they were therein well confirmed by her Majesty’s being well again before night. One Sir Edmund Bury Godfry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4536" id="noteref-4536" epub:type="noteref">4536</a> a woodmonger and justice of Peace in Westminster, having two days since arrested Sir Alexander Frazier<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4537" id="noteref-4537" epub:type="noteref">4537</a> for about £30 in firing, the bailiffs were apprehended, committed to the porter’s lodge, and there, by the King’s command, the last night severely whipped; from which the justice himself very hardly escaped, to such an unusual degree was the King moved therein. But he lies now in the lodge, justifying his act, as grounded upon the opinion of several of the judges, and, among others, my Lord Chief-Justice; which makes the King very angry with the Chief-Justice, as they say; and the justice do lie and justify his act, and says he will suffer in the cause for the people, and do refuse to receive almost any nutriment.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4538" id="noteref-4538" epub:type="noteref">4538</a> The effects of it may be bad to the Court.

				<p><time datetime="1669-06-07">28th</time>. To <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, where the King’s being with the Duke of York prevented a meeting of the Tangier Commission. But, Lord! what a deal of sorry discourse did I hear between the King and several Lords about him here! but very mean methought. So with Creed to the Excise Office, and back to Whitehall, where, in the Park, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret did give me an account of his discourse lately, with the Commissioners of Accounts, who except against many things, but none that I find considerable; among others, that of the Officers of the Navy selling of the King’s goods, and particularly my providing him with calico flags, which having been by order, and but once, when necessity, and the King’s apparent profit, justified it, as conformable to my particular duty, it will prove to my advantage that it be enquired into. Nevertheless, having this morning received from them a demand of an account of all monies within their cognizance, received and issued by me, I was willing, upon this hint, to give myself rest, by knowing whether their meaning therein might reach only to my Treasurership for Tangier, or the monies employed on this occasion. I went, therefore, to them this afternoon, to understand what monies they meant, where they answered me, by saying, “The eleven months’ tax, customs, and prize money,” without mentioning, any more than I demanding, the service they respected therein; and so, without further discourse, we parted, upon very good terms of respect, and with few words, but my mind not fully satisfied about the monies they mean. At noon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gibson and I dined at the Swan, and thence doing this at Brook house, and thence calling at the Excise Office for an account of payment of my tallies for Tangier, I home, and thence with my wife and brother spent the evening on the water, carrying our supper with us, as high as Chelsea; so home, making sport with the Westerne bargees, and my wife and I singing, to my great content.</p>

I heard the Bishop of Peterborough<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4541" id="noteref-4541" epub:type="noteref">4541</a> preach but dully; but a good anthem of Pelham’s. Home to dinner, and then with my wife to Hyde Park, where all the evening; great store of company, and great preparations by the Prince of Tuscany to celebrate the night with fireworks, for the King’s birthday.

Our discourse was upon the notes I have lately prepared for Commanders’ Instructions; but concluded that nothing will render them effectual, without an amendment in the choice of them, that they be seamen, and not gentleman above the command of the Admiral, by the greatness of their relations at Court. Thence to Whitehall, and dined alone with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Chevins his sister: whither by and by come in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Progers and Sir Thomas Allen, and by and by fine <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Wells, who is a great beauty; and there I had my full gaze upon her, to my great content, she being a woman of pretty conversation. Thence to the Duke of York, who, with the officers of the Navy, made a good entrance on my draught of my new Instructions to Commanders, as well expressing general [views] of a reformation among them, as liking of my humble offers towards it. Thence being called by my wife, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gibson and I, we to the Park, whence the rain suddenly home.</p>

Dined at home, and in the afternoon by water to Whitehall, calling by the way at Michell’s, where I have not been many a day till just the other day, and now I met her mother there and knew her husband to be out of town. And here <i xml:lang="fr">je</i> did <i xml:lang="fr">baiser elle</i>, but had not opportunity <i xml:lang="fr">para hazer</i> some with her as I would have offered if <i xml:lang="fr">je</i> had had it. And thence had another meeting with the Duke of York, at Whitehall, on yesterday’s work, and made a good advance: and so, being called by my wife, we to the Park, Mary Batelier, and a Dutch gentleman, a friend of hers, being with us. Thence to “The World’s End,” a drinking-house by the Park; and there merry, and so home late.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>And thus ends all that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my own eyes in the keeping of my journal, I being not able to do it any longer, having done now so long as to undo my eyes almost every time that I take a pen in my hand; and, therefore, whatever comes of it, I must forbear: and, therefore, resolve, from this time forward, to have it kept by my people in longhand, and must therefore be contented to set down no more than is fit for them and all the world to know; or, if there be anything, which cannot be much, now my amours to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> are past, and my eyes hindering me in almost all other pleasures, I must endeavour to keep a margin in my book open, to add, here and there, a note in shorthand with my own hand.</p>
				<p>And so I betake myself to that course, which is almost as much as to see myself go into my grave: for which, and all the discomforts that will accompany my being blind, the good God prepare me!</p>
