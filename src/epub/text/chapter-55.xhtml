			<article id="entry-1664-7-11" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-11">July 1st</time>. Up and within all the morning, first bringing down my Tryangle to my chamber below, having a new frame made proper for it to stand on. By and by comes <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burnett, who assures me that I have an ulcer either in the kidneys or bladder, for my water, which he saw yesterday, he is sure the sediment is not slime gathered by heat, but is a direct pusse. He did write me down some direction<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2208" id="noteref-2208" epub:type="noteref">2208</a> what to do for it, but not with the satisfaction I expected. I did give him a piece, with good hopes, however, that his advice will be of use to me, though it is strange that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hollyard should never say one word of this ulcer in all his life to me. He being gone, I to the ’Change, and thence home to dinner, and so to my office, busy till the evening, and then by agreement came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill and Andrews and one Cheswicke, a maister who plays very well upon the Spinette, and we sat singing Psalms till 9 at night, and so broke up with great pleasure, and very good company it is, and I hope I shall now and then have their company. They being gone, I to my office till towards twelve o’clock, and then home and to bed. Upon the ’Change, this day, I saw how uncertain the temper of the people is, that, from our discharging of about 200 that lay idle, having nothing to do, upon some of our ships, which were ordered to be fitted for service, and their works are now done, the towne do talk that the King discharges all his men, 200 yesterday and 800 today, and that now he hath got £100,000 in his hand, he values not a Dutch warr. But I undeceived a great many, telling them how it is.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-12" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-12">2nd</time>. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the ’Change, and there, which is strange, I could meet with nobody that I could invite home to my venison pasty, but only <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsopp and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon, whom I invited last night, and a friend they brought along with them. So home and with our venison pasty we had other good meat and good discourse. After dinner sat close to discourse about our business of the victualling of the garrison of Tangier, taking their prices of all provisions, and I do hope to order it so that they and I also may get something by it, which do much please me, for I hope I may get nobly and honestly with profit to the King. They being gone came Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Warren, and he and I discoursed long about the business of masts, and then in the evening to my office, where late writing letters, and then home to look over some Brampton papers, which I am under an oathe to dispatch before I spend one half houre in any pleasure or go to bed before 12 o’clock, to which, by the grace of God, I will be true. Then to bed. When I came home I found that tomorrow being Sunday I should gain nothing by doing it tonight, and tomorrow I can do it very well and better than tonight. I went to bed before my time, but with a resolution of doing the thing to better purpose tomorrow.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-13">3rd (Lord’s day)</time>. Up and ready, and all the morning in my chamber looking over and settling some Brampton businesses. At noon to dinner, where the remains of yesterday’s venison and a couple of brave green geese, which we are fain to eat alone, because they will not keepe, which troubled us. After dinner I close to my business, and before the evening did end it with great content, and my mind eased by it. Then up and spent the evening walking with my wife talking, and it thundering and lightning all the evening, and this yeare have had the most of thunder and lightning they say of any in man’s memory, and so it is, it seems, in France and everywhere else. So to prayers and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-14">4th</time>. Up, and many people with me about business, and then out to several places, and so at noon to my Lord Crew’s, and there dined and very much made of there by him. He offered me the selling of some land of his in Cambridgeshire, a purchase of about £1,000, and if I can compass it I will. After dinner I walked homeward, still doing business by the way, and at home find my wife this day of her owne accord to have lain out 25<abbr>s.</abbr> upon a pair of pendantes for her eares, which did vex me and brought both me and her to very high and very foule words from her to me, such as trouble me to think she should have in her mouth, and reflecting upon our old differences, which I hate to have remembered. I vowed to breake them, or that she should go and get what she could for them again. I went with that resolution out of doors; the poor wretch afterwards in a little while did send out to change them for her money again. I followed Besse her messenger at the ’Change, and there did consult and sent her back; I would not have them changed, being satisfied that she yielded. So went home, and friends again as to that business; but the words I could not get out of my mind, and so went to bed at night discontented, and she came to bed to me, but all would not make me friends, but sleep and rise in the morning angry. This day the King and the Queen went to visit my Lord Sandwich and the fleet, going forth in the Hope.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2209" id="noteref-2209" epub:type="noteref">2209</a></p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-15" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-15">5th</time>. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the ’Change a little, then with <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Howe home and dined. So after dinner to my office, and there busy till late at night, having had among other things much discourse with young Gregory about the Chest business, wherein Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten is so great a knave, and also with Alsop and Lanyon about the Tangier victualling, wherein I hope to get something for myself. Late home to supper and to bed, being full of thoughts of a sudden resolution this day taken upon the ’Change of going down tomorrow to the Hope.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-16" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-16">6th</time>. Up very betimes, and my wife also, and got us ready; and about eight o’clock, having got some bottles of wine and beer and neat’s tongues, we went to our barge at the Towre, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pierce and his wife, and a kinswoman and his sister, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clerke and her sister and cousin were to expect us; and so set out for the Hope, all the way down playing at cards and other sports, spending our time pretty merry. Come to the Hope about one and there showed them all the ships, and had a collacion of anchovies, gammon, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and after an houre’s stay or more, embarked again for home; and so to cards and other sports till we came to Greenwich, and there <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clerke and my wife and I on shore to an alehouse, for them to do their business, and so to the barge again, having shown them the King’s pleasure boat; and so home to the Bridge, bringing night home with us; and it rained hard, but we got them on foot to the Beare, and there put them into a boat, and I back to my wife in the barge, and so to the Tower Wharf and home, being very well pleased today with the company, especially <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pierce, who continues her complexion as well as ever, and hath, at this day, I think, the best complexion that ever I saw on any woman, young or old, or child either, all days of my life. Also <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clerke’s kinswoman sings very prettily, but is very confident in it; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Clerke herself witty, but spoils all in being so conceited and making so great a flutter with a few fine clothes and some bad tawdry things worne with them. But the charge of the barge lies heavy upon me, which troubles me, but it is but once, and I may make Pierce do me some courtesy as great. Being come home, I weary to bed with sitting. The reason of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Clerke’s not being here was the King’s being sicke last night and let blood, and so he durst not come away today.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-17" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-17">7th</time>. Up, and this day begun, the first day this year, to put off my linnen waistcoat, but it happening to be a cool day I was afraid of taking cold, which troubles me, and is the greatest pain I have in the world to think of my bad temper of my health. At the office all the morning. Dined at home, to my office to prepare some things against a Committee of Tangier this afternoon. So to Whitehall, and there found the Duke and twenty more reading their commission (of which I am, and was also sent to, to come) for the Royal Fishery, which is very large, and a very serious charter it is; but the company generally so ill fitted for so serious a worke that I do much fear it will come to little. That being done, and not being able to do anything for lacke of an oathe for the Governor and Assistants to take, we rose. Then our Committee for the Tangier victualling met and did a little, and so up, and I and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry walked in the garden half an hour, talking of the business of our masts, and thence away and with Creed walked half an hour or more in the Park, and thence to the New Exchange to drink some creame, but missed it and so parted, and I home, calling by the way for my new bookes, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, Sir <abbr class="name">H.</abbr> Spillman’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Whole Glossary</i>, Scapula’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lexicon</i>, and Shakespeare’s plays, which I have got money out of my stationer’s bills to pay for. So home and to my office a while, and then home and to bed, finding myself pretty well for all my waistecoate being put off today. The king is pretty well today, though let blood the night before yesterday.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-18" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-18">8th</time>. Up and called out by my Lord Peterborough’s gentleman to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy’s to discourse about getting of his money, wherein I am concerned in hopes of the £50 my Lord hath promised me, but I dare not reckon myself sure of it till I have it in my main<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2210" id="noteref-2210" epub:type="noteref">2210</a> for these Lords are hard to be trusted. Though I well deserve it. I stayed at Povy’s for his coming in, and there looked over his stables and every thing, but notwithstanding all the times I have been there I do yet find many fine things to look on. Thence to Whitehall a little, to hear how the King do, he not having been well these three days. I find that he is pretty well again. So to Paul’s Churchyarde about my books, and to the binder’s and directed the doing of my Chaucer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2211" id="noteref-2211" epub:type="noteref">2211</a> though they were not full neate enough for me, but pretty well it is; and thence to the clasp-maker’s to have it clasped and bossed. So to the ’Change and home to dinner, and so to my office till 5 o’clock, and then came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill and Andrews, and we sung an houre or two. Then broke up and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsop and his company came and consulted about our Tangier victualling and brought it to a good head. So they parted, and I to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-19" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-19">9th</time>. Up, and at the office all the morning. In the afternoon by coach with Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes to Whitehall, and there to a Committee for Fishing; but the first thing was swearing to be true to the Company, and we were all sworne; but a great dispute we had, which, methought, is very ominous to the Company; some, that we should swear to be true to the best of our power, and others to the best of our understanding; and carried in the last, though in that we are the least able to serve the Company, because we would not be obliged to attend the business when we can, but when we list. This consideration did displease me, but it was voted and so went. We did nothing else, but broke up till a Committee of Guinny was set and ended, and then met again for Tangier, and there I did my business about my Lord Peterborough’s order and my own for my expenses for the garrison lately. So home, by the way calling for my Chaucer and other books, and that is well done to my mind, which pleased me well. So to my office till late writing letters, and so home to my wife to supper and bed, where we have not lain together because of the heat of the weather a good while, but now against her going into the country.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-20" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-20">10th (Lord’s day)</time>. Up and by water, towards noon, to Somersett House, and walked to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there dined with my Lady and the children. And after some ordinary discourse with my Lady, after dinner took our leaves and my wife hers, in order to her going to the country tomorrow. But my Lord took not occasion to speak one word of my father or mother about the children at all, which I wonder at, and begin I will not. Here my Lady showed us my Lady Castlemayne’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2212" id="noteref-2212" epub:type="noteref">2212</a> picture, finely done; given my Lord; and a most beautiful picture it is. Thence with my Lady Jemimah and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sidney to <abbr>St.</abbr> Gyles’s Church, and there heard a long, poore sermon. Thence set them down and in their coach to Kate Joyce’s christening, where much company, good service of sweetmeates; and after an houre’s stay, left them, and in my Lord’s coach⁠—his noble, rich coach⁠—home, and there my wife fell to putting things in order against her going tomorrow, and I to read, and so to bed, where I not well, and so had no pleasure at all with my poor wife.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-21" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-21">11th</time>. But betimes up this morning, and, getting ready, we by coach to Holborne, where, at nine o’clock, they set out, and I and my man Will on horseback, by my wife, to Barnett; a very pleasant day; and there dined with her company, which was very good; a pretty gentlewoman with her, that goes but to Huntington, and a neighbour to us in towne. Here we stayed two hours and then parted for all together, and my poor wife I shall soon want I am sure. Thence I and Will to see the Wells, half a mile off,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2213" id="noteref-2213" epub:type="noteref">2213</a> and there I drank three glasses, and went and walked and came back and drunk two more; the woman would have had me drink three more; but I could not, my belly being full, but this wrought very well, and so we rode home, round by Kingsland, Hackney, and Mile End till we were quite weary, and my water working at least 7 or 8 times upon the road, which pleased me well, and so home weary, and not being very well, I betimes to bed, and there fell into a most mighty sweat in the night, about eleven o’clock, and there, knowing what money I have in the house and hearing a noyse, I begun to sweat worse and worse, till I melted almost to water. I rung, and could not in half an houre make either of the wenches hear me, and this made me fear the more, lest they might be gaga; and then I begun to think that there was some design in a stone being flung at the window over our stayres this evening, by which the thiefes meant to try what looking there would be after them and know our company. These thoughts and fears I had, and do hence apprehend the fears of all rich men that are covetous and have much money by them. At last Jane rose, and then I understand it was only the dogg wants a lodging and so made a noyse. So to bed, but hardly slept, at last did, and so till morning,</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-22">12th</time>. And so rose, called up by my Lord Peterborough’s gentleman about getting his Lord’s money today of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy, wherein I took such order, that it was paid, and I had my £50 brought me, which comforts my heart. We sat at the office all the morning, then at home. Dined alone; sad for want of company and not being very well, and know not how to eat alone. After dinner down with Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret, Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes, and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten to view, and did like a place by Deptford yard to lay masts in. By and by comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and after a little stay he and I down to Blackwall, he having a mind to see the yarde, which we did, and fine storehouses there are and good docks, but of no great profit to him that oweth them for ought we see.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2214" id="noteref-2214" epub:type="noteref">2214</a> So home by water with him, having good discourse by the way, and so I to the office a while, and late home to supper and to bed.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1664-7-23" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-23">13th</time>. Up and to my office, at noon (after having at an alehouse hard by discoursed with one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tyler, a neighbour, and one Captain Sanders about the discovery of some pursers that have sold their provisions) I to my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there, but they not dining at home, I with Captain Ferrers to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barwell the King’s Squire Sadler, where about this time twelvemonths I dined before at a good venison pasty. The like we had now, and very good company, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tresham and others. Thence to Whitehall to the Fishery, and there did little. So by water home, and there met Lanyon, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, about Tangier matters, and so late to my office, and thence home and to bed. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore was with me late to desire me to come to my Lord Sandwich tomorrow morning, which I shall, but I wonder what my business is.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1664-7-24" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-24">14th</time>. My mind being doubtful what the business should be, I rose a little after four o’clock, and abroad. Walked to my Lord’s, and nobody up, but the porter rose out of bed to me so I back again to Fleet Street, and there bought a little book of law; and thence, hearing a psalm sung, I went into <abbr>St.</abbr> Dunstan’s, and there heard prayers read, which, it seems, is done there every morning at six o’clock; a thing I never did do at a chapel, but the College Chapel, in all my life. Thence to my Lord’s again, and my Lord being up, was sent for up, and he and I alone. He did begin with a most solemn profession of the same confidence in and love for me that he ever had, and then told me what a misfortune was fallen upon me and him: in me, by a displeasure which my Lord Chancellor did show to him last night against me, in the highest and most passionate manner that ever any man did speak, even to the not hearing of anything to be said to him: but he told me, that he did say all that could be said for a man as to my faithfullnesse and duty to his Lordship, and did me the greatest right imaginable. And what should the business be, but that I should be forward to have the trees in Clarendon Park<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2215" id="noteref-2215" epub:type="noteref">2215</a> marked and cut down, which he, it seems, hath bought of my Lord Albemarle; when, God knows! I am the most innocent man in the world in it, and did nothing of myself, nor knew of his concernment therein, but barely obeyed my Lord Treasurer’s warrant for the doing thereof. And said that I did most ungentlemanlike with him, and had justified the rogues in cutting down a tree of his; and that I had sent the veriest Fanatique [Deane] that is in England to mark them, on purpose to nose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2216" id="noteref-2216" epub:type="noteref">2216</a> him. All which, I did assure my Lord, was most properly false, and nothing like it true; and told my Lord the whole passage. My Lord do seem most nearly affected; he is partly, I believe, for me, and partly for himself. So he advised me to wait presently upon my Lord, and clear myself in the most perfect manner I could, with all submission and assurance that I am his creature both in this and all other things; and that I do owne that all I have, is derived through my Lord Sandwich from his Lordship. So, full of horror, I went, and found him busy in tryals of law in his great room; and it being Sitting-day, durst not stay, but went to my Lord and told him so: whereupon he directed me to take him after dinner; and so away I home, leaving my Lord mightily concerned for me. I to the office, and there sat busy all the morning. At noon to the ’Change, and from the ’Change over with Alsopp and the others to the Pope’s Head tavern, and there stayed a quarter of an hour, and concluded upon this, that in case I got them no more than 3<abbr>s.</abbr> per week per man I should have of them but £150 per <abbr>ann.</abbr>, but to have it without any adventure or charge, but if I got them 3<abbr>s.</abbr> 2<abbr>d.</abbr>, then they would give me £300 in the like manner. So I directed them to draw up their tender in a line or two against the afternoon, and to meet me at Whitehall. So I left them, and I to my Lord Chancellor’s; and there coming out after dinner I accosted him, telling him that I was the unhappy Pepys that had fallen into his high displeasure, and come to desire him to give me leave to make myself better understood to his Lordship, assuring him of my duty and service. He answered me very pleasingly, that he was confident upon the score of my Lord Sandwich’s character of me, but that he had reason to think what he did, and desired me to call upon him some evening: I named tonight, and he accepted of it. So with my heart light I to Whitehall, and there after understanding by a stratagem, and yet appearing wholly desirous not to understand <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden’s price when he desired to show it me, I went down and ordered matters in our tender so well that at the meeting by and by I was ready with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden’s and his, both directed him a letter to me to give the board their two tenders, but there being none but the Generall Monk and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry and Povy and I, I did not think fit to expose them to view now, but put it off till Saturday, and so with good content rose. Thence I to the Half Moone, against the ’Change, to acquaint Lanyon and his friends of our proceedings, and thence to my Lord Chancellor’s, and there heard several tryals, wherein I perceive my Lord is a most able and ready man. After all done, he himself called, “Come, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys, you and I will take a turn in the garden.” So he was led downstairs, having the goute, and there walked with me, I think, above an houre, talking most friendly, yet cunningly. I told him clearly how things were; how ignorant I was of his Lordship’s concernment in it; how I did not do nor say one word singly, but what was done was the act of the whole Board. He told me by name that he was more angry with Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret than with me, and also with the whole body of the Board. But thinking who it was of the Board that knew him least, he did place his fear upon me; but he finds that he is indebted to none of his friends there. I think I did thoroughly appease him, till he thanked me for my desire and pains to satisfy him; and upon my desiring to be directed who I should of his servants advise with about this business, he told me nobody, but would be glad to hear from me himself. He told me he would not direct me in anything, that it might not be said that the Lord Chancellor did labour to abuse the King; or (as I offered) direct the suspending the Report of the Purveyors but I see what he means, and I will make it my worke to do him service in it. But, Lord! to see how he is incensed against poor Deane, as a fanatique rogue, and I know not what: and what he did was done in spite to his Lordship, among all his friends and tenants. He did plainly say that he would not direct me in anything, for he would not put himself into the power of any man to say that he did so and so; but plainly told me as if he would be glad I did something. Lord! to see how we poor wretches dare not do the King good service for fear of the greatness of these men. He named Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret, and Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes, and the rest; and that he was as angry with them all as me. But it was pleasant to think that, while he was talking to me, comes into the garden Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret; and my Lord avoided speaking with him, and made him and many others stay expecting him, while I walked up and down above an houre, I think; and would have me walk with my hat on. And yet, after all this, there has been so little ground for this his jealousy of me, that I am sometimes afeard that he do this only in policy to bring me to his side by scaring me; or else, which is worse, to try how faithfull I would be to the King; but I rather think the former of the two. I parted with great assurance how I acknowledged all I had to come from his Lordship; which he did not seem to refuse, but with great kindness and respect parted. So I by coach home, calling at my Lord’s, but he not within. At my office late, and so home to eat something, being almost starved for want of eating my dinner today, and so to bed, my head being full of great and many businesses of import to me.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-25" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-25">15th</time>. Up, and to my Lord Sandwich’s; where he sent for me up, and I did give my Lord an account of what had passed with my Lord Chancellor yesterday; with which he was well pleased, and advised me by all means to study in the best manner I could to serve him in this business. After this discourse ended, he begun to tell me that he had now pitched upon his day of going to sea upon Monday next, and that he would now give me an account how matters are with him. He told me that his work now in the world is only to keep up his interest at Court, having little hopes to get more considerably, he saying that he hath now about £8,000 per annum. It is true, he says, he oweth about £10,000; but he hath been at great charges in getting things to this pass in his estate; besides his building and good goods that he hath bought. He says he hath now evened his reckonings at the Wardrobe till Michaelmas last, and hopes to finish it to Ladyday before he goes. He says now there is due, too, £7,000 to him there, if he knew how to get it paid, besides £2,000 that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu do owe him. As to his interest, he says that he hath had all the injury done him that ever man could have by another bosom friend that knows all his secrets, by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu; but he says that the worst of it all is past, and he gone out and hated, his very person by the King, and he believes the more upon the score of his carriage to him; nay, that the Duke of York did say a little while since in his closet, that he did hate him because of his ungrateful carriage to my Lord of Sandwich. He says that he is as great with the Chancellor, or greater, than ever in his life. That with the King he is the like; and told me an instance, that whereas he formerly was of the private council to the King before he was last sicke, and that by the sickness an interruption was made in his attendance upon him; the King did not constantly call him, as he used to do, to his private council, only in businesses of the sea and the like; but of late the King did send a message to him by Sir Harry Bennet, to excuse the King to my Lord that he had not of late sent for him as he used to do to his private council, for it was not out of any distaste, but to avoid giving offence to some others whom he did not name; but my Lord supposes it might be Prince Rupert, or it may be only that the King would rather pass it by an excuse, than be thought unkind: but that now he did desire him to attend him constantly, which of late he hath done, and the King never more kind to him in his life than now. The Duke of York, as much as is possible; and in the business of late, when I was to speak to my Lord about his going to sea, he says that he finds the Duke did it with the greatest ingenuity and love in the world; “and whereas,” says my Lord, “here is a wise man hard by that thinks himself so, and would be thought so, and it may be is in a degree so (naming by and by my Lord Crew), would have had me condition with him that neither Prince Rupert nor anybody should come over his head, and I know not what.” The Duke himself hath caused in his commission, that he be made Admiral of this and what other ships or fleets shall hereafter be put out after these; which is very noble. He tells me in these cases, and that of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Montagu’s, and all others, he finds that bearing of them patiently is his best way, without noise or trouble, and things wear out of themselves and come fair again. But, says he, take it from me, never to trust too much to any man in the world, for you put yourself into his power; and the best seeming friend and real friend as to the present may have or take occasion to fall out with you, and then out comes all. Then he told me of Sir Harry Bennet, though they were always kind, yet now it is become to an acquaintance and familiarity above ordinary, that for these months he hath done no business but with my Lord’s advice in his chamber, and promises all faithfull love to him and service upon all occasions. My Lord says, that he hath the advantage of being able by his experience to helpe and advise him; and he believes that that chiefly do invite Sir Harry to this manner of treating him. “Now,” says my Lord, “the only and the greatest embarras that I have in the world is, how to behave myself to Sir <abbr class="name">H.</abbr> Bennet and my Lord Chancellor, in case that there do lie anything under the embers about my Lord Bristoll, which nobody can tell; for then,” says he, “I must appear for one or other, and I will lose all I have in the world rather than desert my Lord Chancellor: so that,” says he, “I know not for my life what to do in that case.” For Sir <abbr class="name">H.</abbr> Bennet’s love is come to the height, and his confidence, that he hath given my Lord a character,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2217" id="noteref-2217" epub:type="noteref">2217</a> and will oblige my Lord to correspond with him. “This,” says he, “is the whole condition of my estate and interest; which I tell you, because I know not whether I shall see you again or no.” Then as to the voyage, he thinks it will be of charge to him, and no profit; but that he must not now look after nor think to encrease, but study to make good what he hath, that what is due to him from the Wardrobe or elsewhere may be paid, which otherwise would fail, and all a man hath be but small content to him. So we seemed to take leave one of another; my Lord of me, desiring me that I would write to him and give him information upon all occasions in matters that concern him; which, put together with what he preambled with yesterday, makes me think that my Lord do truly esteem me still, and desires to preserve my service to him; which I do bless God for. In the middle of our discourse my Lady Crew came in to bring my Lord word that he hath another son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2218" id="noteref-2218" epub:type="noteref">2218</a> my Lady being brought to bed just now, I did not think her time had been so nigh, but she’s well brought to bed, for which God be praised! and send my Lord to study the laying up of something the more! Then with Creed to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, and missing <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, to Whitehall; where, staying for him in one of the galleries, there comes out of the chayre-room <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stewart, in a most lovely form, with her hair all about her eares, having her picture taking there. There was the King and twenty more, I think, standing by all the while, and a lovely creature she in this dress seemed to be. Thence to the ’Change by coach, and so home to dinner and then to my office. In the evening <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill, Andrews and I to my chamber to sing, which we did very pleasantly, and then to my office again, where very late and so home, with my mind I bless God in good state of ease and body of health, only my head at this juncture very full of business, how to get something. Among others what this rogue Creed will do before he goes to sea, for I would fain be rid of him and see what he means to do, for I will then declare myself his firm friend or enemy.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-07-26">16th</time>. Up in the morning, my head mightily confounded with the great deal of business I have upon me to do. But to the office, and there dispatched <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Creed’s business pretty well about his bill; but then there comes <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Howe for my Lord’s bill of Imprest for £500 to carry with him this voyage, and so I was at a loss how to carry myself in it, Creed being there, but there being no help I delivered it to them both, and let them contend, when I perceive they did both endeavour to have it, but <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Howe took it, and the other had the discretion to suffer it. But I think I cleared myself to Creed that it past not from any practice of mine. At noon rose and did some necessary business at the ’Change. Thence to Trinity House to a dinner which Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret makes there as Maister this year. Thence to Whitehall to the Tangier Committee, and there, above my expectation, got the business of our contract for the victualling carried for my people, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, Alsopp, Lanyon, and Yeabsly; and by their promise I do thereby get £300 per annum to myself, which do overjoy me; and the matter is left to me to draw up. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lewes was in the gallery and is mightily amazed at it, and I believe <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden will make some stir about it, for he wrote to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry today about it to argue why he should for the King’s convenience have it, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry most justly did argue freely for them that served cheapest. Thence walked a while with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry in the gallery, and first find that he is mighty cold in his present opinion of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Peter Pett for his flagging and doing things so lazily there, and he did also surprise me with a question why Deane did not bring in their report of the timber of Clarendon. What he means thereby I know not, but at present put him off; nor do I know how to steer myself: but I must think of it, and advise with my Lord Sandwich. Thence with Creed by coach to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there I got <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Moore to give me my Lord’s hand for my receipt of £109 more of my money of Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret, so that then his debt to me will be under £500, I think. This do ease my mind also. Thence carried him and <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Howe into London, and set them down at Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret’s to receive some money, and I home and there busy very late, and so home to supper and to bed, with my mind in pretty good ease, my business being in a pretty good condition everywhere.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-07-27">17th (Lord’s day)</time>. All the morning at my office doing business there, it raining hard. So dined at home alone. After dinner walked to my Lord’s, and there found him and much other guests at table at dinner, and it seems they have christened his young son today⁠—called him James. I got a piece of cake. I got my Lord to signe and seale my business about my selling of Brampton land, which though not so full as I would, yet is as full as I can at present. Walked home again, and there fell to read, and by and by comes my uncle Wight, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burnett, and another gentleman, and talked and drank, and the Doctor showed me the manner of eating turpentine, which pleases me well, for it is with great ease. So they being gone, I to supper and to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-28" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-28">18th</time>. Up, and walked to my Lord’s, and there took my leave of him, he seeming very friendly to me in as serious a manner as ever in his life, and I believe he is very confident of me. He sets out this morning for Deale. Thence to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s to the Duke, and there did our usual business. He discourses very freely of a warr with Holland, to begin about winter, so that I believe we shall come to it. Before we went up to the Duke, Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret and I did talk together in the Park about my Lord Chancellor’s business of the timber; he telling me freely that my Lord Chancellor was never so angry with him in all his life, as he was for this business, in great passion; and that when he saw me there, he knew what it was about. And plots now with me how we may serve my Lord, which I am mightily glad of; and I hope together we may do it. Thence to Westminster to my barber’s, to have my Periwigg he lately made me cleansed of its nits, which vexed me cruelly that he should put such a thing into my hands. Here meeting his maid Jane, that has lived with them so long, I talked with her, and sending her of an errand to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Clerk’s, did meet her, and took her into a little alehouse in Brewers Yard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2219" id="noteref-2219" epub:type="noteref">2219</a> and there did sport with her, without any knowledge of her though, and a very pretty innocent girl she is. Thence to my Lord Chancellor’s, but he being busy I went away to the ’Change, and so home to dinner. By and by comes Creed, and I out with him to Fleet Street, and he to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy’s, I to my Lord Chancellor’s, and missing him again walked to Povy’s, and there saw his new perspective in his closet. Povy, to my great surprise and wonder, did here attacque me in his own and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bland’s behalf that I should do for them both for the new contractors for the victualling of the garrison. Which I am ashamed that he should ask of me, nor did I believe that he was a man that did seek benefit in such poor things. Besides that he professed that he did not believe that I would have any hand myself in the contract, and yet here declares that he himself would have profit by it, and himself did move me that Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Rider might join, and Ford with Gauden. I told him I had no interest in them, but I fear they must do something to him, for he told me that those of the Mole did promise to consider him. Thence home and Creed with me, and there he took occasion to owne his obligations to me, and did lay down twenty pieces in gold upon my shelf in my closet, which I did not refuse, but wish and expected should have been more. But, however, this is better than nothing, and now I am out of expectation, and shall henceforward know how to deal with him. After discourse of settling his matters here, we went out by coach, and he ’light at the Temple, and there took final leave of me, in order to his following my Lord tomorrow. I to my Lord Chancellor, and discoursed his business with him. I perceive, and he says plainly, that he will not have any man to have it in his power to say that my Lord Chancellor did contrive the wronging the King of his timber; but yet I perceive, he would be glad to have service done him therein; and told me Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret hath told him that he and I would look after his business to see it done in the best manner for him. Of this I was glad, and so away. Thence home, and late with my Tangier men about drawing up their agreement with us, wherein I find much trouble, and after doing as much as we could tonight, broke up and I to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-07-29">19th</time>. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon dined alone at home. After dinner Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten and I down by water to Woolwich, where coming to the ropeyarde we are told that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer, who hath been ill of a relapse these two days, is just now dead. We went up to his widow, who is sicke in bed also. The poor woman in great sorrow, and entreats our friendship, which we shall, I think, in every thing do for her. I am sure I will. Thence to the Docke, and there in Sheldon’s garden eat some fruit; so to Deptford a little, and thence home, it raining mightily, and being cold I doubted my health after it. At the office till 9 o’clock about Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Warren’s contract for masts, and then at home with Lanyon and Yeabsly till 12 and past about their contract for Tangier, wherein they and I differed, for I would have it drawn to the King’s advantage, as much as might be, which they did not like, but parted good friends; however, when they were gone, I wished that I had forborne any disagreement till I had had their promise to me in writing. They being gone, I to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-30" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-30">20th</time>. Up, and a while to my office, and then home with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Deane till dinner, discoursing upon the business of my Lord Chancellor’s timber in Clarendon Park, and how to make a report therein without offending him; which at last I drew up, and hope it will please him. But I would to God neither I nor he ever had had anything to have done with it! Dined together with a good pig, and then out by coach to Whitehall, to the Committee for Fishing; but nothing done, it being a great day today there upon drawing at the Lottery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2220" id="noteref-2220" epub:type="noteref">2220</a> of Sir Arthur Slingsby. I got in and stood by the two Queenes and the Duchesse of York, and just behind my Lady Castlemayne, whom I do heartily adore; and good sport it was to see how most that did give their ten pounds did go away with a pair of globes only for their lot, and one gentlewoman, one <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fish, with the only blanke. And one I stayed to see drew a suit of hangings valued at £430, and they say are well worth the money, or near it. One other suit there is better than that; but very many lots of three and fourscore pounds. I observed the King and Queenes did get but as poor lots as any else. But the wisest man I met with was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cholmley, who insured as many as would, from drawing of the one blank for 12<abbr>d.</abbr>; in which case there was the whole number of persons to one, which I think was three or four hundred. And so he insured about 200 for 200 shillings, so that he could not have lost if one of them had drawn it, for there was enough to pay the £10; but it happened another drew it, and so he got all the money he took. I left the lottery, and went to a play, only a piece of it, which was the Duke’s house, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Worse and Worse</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2221" id="noteref-2221" epub:type="noteref">2221</a> just the same manner of play, and writ, I believe, by the same man as <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Adventures of Five Hours</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2222" id="noteref-2222" epub:type="noteref">2222</a> very pleasant it was, and I begin to admire Harris more than ever. Thence to Westminster to see Creed, and he and I took a walk in the Park. He is ill, and not able yet to set out after my Lord, but will do tomorrow. So home, and late at my office, and so home to bed. This evening being moonshine I played a little late upon my flageolette in the garden. But being at Westminster Hall I met with great news that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lane is married to one Martin, one that serves Captain Marsh. She is gone abroad with him today, very fine. I must have a bout with her very shortly to see how she finds marriage.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-7-31" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-07-31">21st</time>. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, among other things making a contract with Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Warren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2223" id="noteref-2223" epub:type="noteref">2223</a> for almost 1,000 Gottenburg masts, the biggest that ever was made in the Navy, and wholly of my compassing and a good one I hope it is for the King. Dined at Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten’s, where I have not eat these many months. Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes, and myself there only, and my Lady. A good venison pasty, and very merry, and pleasant I made myself with my Lady, and she as much to me. This morning to the office comes Nicholas Osborne, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden’s clerke, to desire of me what piece of plate I would choose to have a £100, or thereabouts, bestowed upon me in, he having order to lay out so much; and, out of his freedom with me, do of himself come to make this question. I a great while urged my unwillingnesse to take any, not knowing how I could serve <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden, but left it wholly to himself; so at noon I find brought home in fine leather cases, a pair of the noblest flaggons that ever I saw all the days of my life; whether I shall keepe them or no I cannot tell; for it is to oblige me to him in the business of the Tangier victualling, wherein I doubt I shall not; but glad I am to see that I shall be sure to get something on one side or other, have it which will: so, with a merry heart, I looked upon them, and locked them up. After dinner to [give] my Lord Chancellor a good account of his business, and he is very well pleased therewith, and carries himself with great discretion to me, without seeming over glad or beholding to me; and yet I know that he do think himself very well served by me. Thence to Westminster and to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lane’s lodgings, to give her joy, and there suffered me to deal with her as I hoped to do, and by and by her husband comes, a sorry, simple fellow, and his letter to her which she proudly showed me a simple, nonsensical thing. A man of no discourse, and I fear married her to make a prize of, which he is mistaken in, and a sad wife I believe she will prove to him, for she urged me to appoint a time as soon as he is gone out of town to give her a meeting next week. So by water with a couple of cozens of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lane’s, and set them down at Queenhive, and I through Bridge home, and there late at business, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-01">22nd</time>. Up and to my office, where busy all the morning. At noon to the ’Change, and so home to dinner, and then down by water to Deptford, where coming too soon, I spent an houre in looking round the yarde, and putting <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shish<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2224" id="noteref-2224" epub:type="noteref">2224</a> to measure a piece or two of timber, which he did most cruelly wrong, and to the King’s losse 12 or 13<abbr>s.</abbr> in a piece of 28 feet in contents. Thence to the Clerke of the Cheques, from whose house <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer was buried today; Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes and I the only principal officers that were there. We walked to church with him, and then I left them without staying the sermon and straight home by water, and there find, as I expected, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill, and Andrews, and one slovenly and ugly fellow, Seignor Pedro, who sings Italian songs to the theorbo most neatly, and they spent the whole evening in singing the best piece of musique counted of all hands in the world, made by Seignor Charissimi,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2225" id="noteref-2225" epub:type="noteref">2225</a> the famous master in Rome. Fine it was, indeed, and too fine for me to judge of. They have spoke to Pedro to meet us every weeke, and I fear it will grow a trouble to me if we once come to bid judges to meet us, especially idle Masters, which do a little displease me to consider. They gone comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon, who tells me <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsopp is now become dangerously ill, and fears his recovery, covery, which shakes my expectation of £630 per annum by the business; and, therefore, bless God for what <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden hath sent me, which, from some discourse today with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Osborne, swearing that he knows not anything of this business of the victualling; but, the contrary, that it is not that moves <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden to send it me, for he hath had order for it any time these two months. Whether this be true or no, I know not; but I shall hence with the more confidence keepe it. To supper and to the office a little, and to walk in the garden, the moon shining bright, and fine warm fair weather, and so home to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-2" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-02">23rd</time>. Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon to the ’Change, where I took occasion to break the business of my Lord Chancellor’s timber to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry in the best manner I could. He professed to me, that, till, Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret did speake of it at the table, after our officers were gone to survey it, he did not know that my Lord Chancellor had anything to do with it; but now he says that he had been told by the Duke that Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret had spoke to him about it, and that he had told the Duke that, were he in my Lord Chancellor’s case, if he were his father, he would rather fling away the gains of two or £3,000, than have it said that the timber, which should have been the King’s, if it had continued the Duke of Albemarle’s, was concealed by us in favour of my Lord Chancellor; for, says he, he is a great man, and all such as he, and he himself particularly, have a great many enemies that would be glad of such an advantage against him. When I told him it was strange that Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes and Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret, that knew my Lord Chancellor’s concernment therein, should not at first inform us, he answered me that for Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes, he is looked upon to be an old good companion, but by nobody at the other end of the towne as any man of business, and that my Lord Chancellor, he dares say, never did tell him of it, only Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret, he do believe, must needs know it, for he and Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Shaw are the greatest confidants he hath in the world. So for himself, he said, he would not mince the matter, but was resolved to do what was fit, and stand upon his owne legs therein, and that he would speak to the Duke, that he and Sir <abbr class="name">G.</abbr> Carteret might be appointed to attend my Lord Chancellor in it. All this disturbs me mightily. I know not what to say to it, nor how to carry myself therein; for a compliance will discommend me to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry, and a discompliance to my Lord Chancellor. But I think to let it alone, or at least meddle in it as little more as I can. From thence walked toward Westminster, and being in an idle and wanton humour, walked through Fleet Alley, and there stood a most pretty wench at one of the doors, so I took a turn or two, but what by sense of honour and conscience I would not go in, but much against my will took coach and away, and away to Westminster Hall, and there ’light of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lane, and plotted with her to go over the water. So met at White’s stairs in Chanel Row, and over to the old house at Lambeth Marsh, and there eat and drank, and had my pleasure of her twice, she being the strangest woman in talk of love to her husband sometimes, and sometimes again she do not care for him, and yet willing enough to allow me a liberty of doing what I would with her. So spending 5<abbr>s.</abbr> or 6<abbr>s.</abbr> upon her, I could do what I would, and after an hour’s stay and more back again and set her ashore there again, and I forward to Fleet Street, and called at Fleet Alley, not knowing how to command myself, and went in and there saw what formerly I have been acquainted with, the wickedness of these houses, and the forcing a man to present expense. The woman indeed is a most lovely woman, but I had no courage to meddle with her for fear of her not being wholesome, and so counterfeiting that I had not money enough, it was pretty to see how cunning she was, would not suffer me to have to do in any manner with her after she saw I had no money, but told me then I would not come again, but she now was sure I would come again, but I hope in God I shall not, for though she be one of the prettiest women I ever saw, yet I fear her abusing me. So desiring God to forgive me for this vanity, I went home, taking some books from my bookseller, and taking his lad home with me, to whom I paid £10 for books I have laid up money for, and laid out within these three weeks, and shall do no more a great while I hope. So to my office writing letters, and then home and to bed, weary of the pleasure I have had today, and ashamed to think of it.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-04">25th</time>. Up, and with Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten by coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, but there the Duke being gone out we to my Lord Berkeley’s chamber, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry being there, and among other things there met with a printed copy of the King’s commission for the repair of Paul’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2226" id="noteref-2226" epub:type="noteref">2226</a> which is very large, and large power for collecting money, and recovering of all people that had bought or sold formerly anything belonging to the Church. And here I find my Lord Mayor of the City set in order before the Archbishopp or any nobleman, though all the greatest officers of state are there. But yet I do not hear by my Lord Berkeley, who is one of them, that anything is like to come of it. Thence back again homewards, and Sir <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Batten and I to the Coffeehouse, but no news, only the plague is very hot still, and encreases among the Dutch. Home to dinner, and after dinner walked forth, and do what I could I could not keep myself from going through Fleet Lane, but had the sense of safety and honour not to go in, and the rather being a holiday I feared I might meet with some people that might know me. Thence to Charing Cross, and there called at Unthanke’s to see what I owed, but found nothing, and here being a couple of pretty ladies, lodgers in the kitchen, I stayed a little there. Thence to my barber Gervas, who this day buries his child, which it seems was born without a passage behind, so that it never voided anything in the week or fortnight that it has been born. Thence to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reeves, it coming just now in my head to buy a microscope, but he was not within, so I walked all round that end of the town among the loathsome people and houses, but, God be thanked! had no desire to visit any of them. So home, where I met <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon, who tells me <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsop is past hopes, which will mightily disappoint me in my hopes there, and yet it may be not. I shall think whether it will be safe for me to venture myself or no, and come in as an adventurer. He gone, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cole (my old Jack Cole) comes to see and speak with me, and his errand in short to tell me that he is giving over his trade; he can do no good in it, and will turn what he has into money and go to sea, his father being dead and leaving him little, if anything. This I was sorry to hear, he being a man of good parts, but, I fear, debauched. I promised him all the friendship I can do him, which will end in little, though I truly mean it, and so I made him stay with me till 11 at night, talking of old school stories, and very pleasing ones, and truly I find that we did spend our time and thoughts then otherwise than I think boys do now, and I think as well as methinks that the best are now. He supped with me, and so away, and I to bed. And strange to see how we are all divided that were bred so long at school together, and what various fortunes we have run, some good, some bad.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-05">26th</time>. All the morning at the office, at noon to Anthony Joyce’s, to our gossip’s dinner. I had sent a dozen and a half of bottles of wine thither, and paid my double share besides, which is 18<abbr>s.</abbr> Very merry we were, and when the women were merry and rose from table, I above with them, ne’er a man but I, I began discourse of my not getting of children, and prayed them to give me their opinions and advice, and they freely and merrily did give me these ten, among them</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Do not hug my wife too hard nor too much;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>eat no late suppers;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>drink juice of sage;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>tent and toast;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>wear cool holland drawers;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>keep stomach warm and back cool;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>upon query whether it was best to do at night or morn, they answered me neither one nor other, but when we had most mind to it;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>wife not to go too straight laced;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>myself to drink mum and sugar;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ward did give me, to change my place.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th they all did seriously declare, and lay much stress upon them as rules fit to be observed indeed, and especially the last, to lie with our heads where our heels do, or at least to make the bed high at feet and low at head. Very merry all, as much as I could be in such sorry company. Great discourse of the fray yesterday in Moorefields, how the butchers at first did beat the weavers (between whom there hath been ever an old competition for mastery), but at last the weavers rallied and beat them. At first the butchers knocked down all for weavers that had green or blue aprons, till they were fain to pull them off and put them in their breeches. At last the butchers were fain to pull off their sleeves, that they might not be known, and were soundly beaten out of the field, and some deeply wounded and bruised; till at last the weavers went out tryumphing, calling £100 for a butcher. I to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Reeves to see a microscope, he having been with me today morning, and there chose one which I will have. Thence back and took up young <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Harman, a pretty bred and pretty humoured woman whom I could love well, though not handsome, yet for her person and carriage, and black. By the way met her husband going for her, and set them both down at home, and so home to my office a while, and so to supper and bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-06">27th</time>. Up, and after some discourse with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Duke, who is to be Secretary to the Fishery,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2227" id="noteref-2227" epub:type="noteref">2227</a> and is now Secretary to the Committee for Trade, who I find a very ingenious man, I went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy’s, and there heard a little of his empty discourse, and fain he would have <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden been the victualler for Tangier, which none but a fool would say to me when he knows he hath made it his request to me to get him something of these men that now do it. Thence to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Coventry being ill and in bed I did not stay, but to Whitehall a little, walked up and down, and so home to fit papers against this afternoon, and after dinner to the ’Change a little, and then to Whitehall, where anon the Duke of York came, and a Committee we had of Tangier, where I read over my rough draught of the contract for Tangier victualling, and acquainted them with the death of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsopp, which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon had told me this morning, which is a sad consideration to see how uncertain a thing our lives are, and how little to be presumed of in our greatest undertakings. The words of the contract approved of, and I home and there came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon to me and brought my neighbour, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Andrews, to me, whom he proposes for his partner in the room of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsopp, and I like well enough of it. We read over the contract together, and discoursed it well over and so parted, and I am glad to see it once over in this condition again, for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon and I had some discourse today about my share in it, and I hope if it goes on to have my first hopes of £300 per <abbr class="eoc">ann.</abbr> They gone, I to supper and to bed. This afternoon came my great store of Coles in, being 10 Chaldron, so that I may see how long they will last me.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-07">28th</time>. At the office all the morning, dined, after ’Change, at home, and then abroad, and seeing <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Bondman</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2228" id="noteref-2228" epub:type="noteref">2228</a> upon the posts, I consulted my oaths and find I may go safely this time without breaking it; I went thither, notwithstanding my great desire to have gone to Fleet Alley, God forgive me, again. There I saw it acted. It is true, for want of practice, they had many of them forgot their parts a little; but Betterton and my poor Ianthe outdo all the world. There is nothing more taking in the world with me than that play. Thence to Westminster to my barber’s, and strange to think how when I find that Jervas himself did intend to bring home my periwigg, and not Jane his maid, I did desire not to have it at all, for I had a mind to have her bring it home. I also went to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blagrave’s about speaking to him for his kinswoman to come live with my wife, but they are not come to town, and so I home by coach and to my office, and then to supper and to bed. My present posture is thus: my wife in the country and my maid Besse with her and all quiet there. I am endeavouring to find a woman for her to my mind, and above all one that understands musique, especially singing. I am the willinger to keepe one because I am in good hopes to get 2 or £300 per annum extraordinary by the business of the victualling of Tangier, and yet <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alsopp, my chief hopes, is dead since my looking after it, and now <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon, I fear, is, falling sicke too. I am pretty well in health, only subject to wind upon any cold, and then immediate and great pains. All our discourse is of a Dutch warr and I find it is likely to come to it, for they are very high and desire not to compliment us at all, as far as I hear, but to send a good fleet to Guinny to oppose us there. My Lord Sandwich newly gone to sea, and I, I think, fallen into his very good opinion again, at least he did before his going, and by his letter since, show me all manner of respect and confidence. I am overjoyed in hopes that upon this month’s account I shall find myself worth £1,000, besides the rich present of two silver and gilt flaggons which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gauden did give me the other day. I do now live very prettily at home, being most seriously, quietly, and neatly served by my two maids Jane and the girle Su, with both of whom I am mightily well pleased. My greatest trouble is the settling of Brampton Estate, that I may know what to expect, and how to be able to leave it when I die, so as to be just to my promise to my uncle Thomas and his son. The next thing is this cursed trouble my brother Tom is likely to put us to by his death, forcing us to law with his creditors, among others <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Tom Pepys, and that with some shame as trouble, and the last how to know in what manner as to saving or spending my father lives, lest they should run me in debt as one of my uncle’s executors, and I never the wiser nor better for it. But in all this I hope shortly to be at leisure to consider and inform myself well.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1664-08-08">29th</time>. At the office all the morning dispatching of business, at noon to the ’Change after dinner, and thence to Tom Trice about <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Pepys’s business, and thence it raining turned into Fleet Alley, and there was with Cocke an hour or so. The jade, whether I would not give her money or not enough; she would not offer to invite to do anything, but on the contrary saying she had no time, which I was glad of, for I had no mind to meddle with her, but had my end to see what a cunning jade she was, to see her impudent tricks and ways of getting money and raising the reckoning by still calling for things, that it come to 6 or 7 shillings presently. So away home, glad I escaped without any inconvenience, and there came <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill, Andrews and Seignor Pedro, and great store of musique we had, but I begin to be weary of having a master with us, for it spoils, methinks, the ingenuity of our practice. After they were gone comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bland to me, sat till 11 at night with me, talking of the garrison of Tangier and serving them with pieces of eight. A mind he hath to be employed there, but dares not desire any courtesy of me, and yet would fain engage me to be for him, for I perceive they do all find that I am the busy man to see the King have right done him by inquiring out other bidders. Being quite tired with him, I got him gone, and so to bed.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-9" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-09">30th</time>. All the morning at the office; at noon to the ’Change, where great talk of a rich present brought by an East India ship from some of the Princes of India, worth to the King £70,000 in two precious stones. After dinner to the office, and there all the afternoon making an end of several things against the end of the month, that I may clear all my reckonings tomorrow; also this afternoon, with great content, I finished the contracts for victualling of Tangier with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lanyon and the rest, and to my comfort got him and Andrews to sign to the giving me £300 per annum, by which, at least, I hope to be a £100 or two the better. Wrote many letters by the post to ease my mind of business and to clear my paper of minutes, as I did lately oblige myself to clear everything against the end of the month. So at night with my mind quiet and contented to bed. This day I sent a side of venison and six bottles of wine to Kate Joyce.</p>

			<article id="entry-1664-8-10" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1664-08-10">31st (Lord’s day)</time>. Up, and to church, where I have not been these many weeks. So home, and thither, inviting him yesterday, comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill, at which I was a little troubled, but made up all very well, carrying him with me to Sir <abbr class="name">J.</abbr> Minnes, where I was invited and all our families to a venison pasty. Here good cheer and good discourse. After dinner <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hill and I to my house, and there to musique all the afternoon. He being gone, in the evening I to my accounts, and to my great joy and with great thanks to Almighty God, I do find myself most clearly worth £1,014, the first time that ever I was worth £1,000 before, which is the height of all that ever I have for a long time pretended to. But by the blessing of God upon my care I hope to lay up something more in a little time, if this business of the victualling of Tangier goes on as I hope it will. So with praise to God for this state of fortune that I am brought to as to wealth, and my condition being as I have at large set it down two days ago in this book, I home to supper and to bed, desiring God to give me the grace to make good use of what I have and continue my care and diligence to gain more.</p>
