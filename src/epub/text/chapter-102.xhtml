				<p><time datetime="1668-06-11">June 1st</time>. Up and with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes to Westminster, and in the Hall there I met with Harris and Rolt, and carried them to the Rhenish wine-house,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4079" id="noteref-4079" epub:type="noteref">4079</a> where I have not been in a morning⁠—nor any tavern, I think, these seven years and more. Here I did get the words of a song of Harris that I wanted. Here also <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Young and Whistler by chance met us, and drank with us. Thence home, and to prepare business against the afternoon, and did walk an hour in the garden with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Warren, who do tell me of the great difficulty he is under in the business of his accounts with the Commissioners of Parliament, and I fear some inconveniences and troubles may be occasioned thereby to me. So to dinner, and then with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes to Whitehall, and there attended the Lords of the Treasury and also a committee of Council with the Duke of York about the charge of this year’s fleet, and thence I to Westminster and to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Martin’s, and did <i xml:lang="fr">hazer</i> what <i xml:lang="fr">je</i> would <i xml:lang="es">con</i> her, and did once <i xml:lang="fr">toker la</i> thigh <i xml:lang="fr">de</i> <i xml:lang="es">su</i> landlady, and thence all alone to Fox Hall, and walked and saw young Newport, and two more rogues of the town, seize on two ladies, who walked with them an hour with their masks on; perhaps civil ladies; and there I left them, and so home, and thence to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills’s, where I never was before, and here find, whom I indeed saw go in, and that did make me go thither, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hallworthy and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Andrews, and here supped, and, extraordinary merry till one in the morning, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Andrews coming to us: and mightily pleased with this night’s company and mirth I home to bed. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, too, was with us.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-06-12">2nd</time>. Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and there dined with me, besides my own people, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Batelier and Mercer, and we very merry. After dinner, they gone, only Mercer and I to sing a while, and then parted, and I out and took a coach, and called Mercer at their backdoor, and she brought with her <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Knightly, a little pretty sober girl, and I carried them to Old Ford, a town by Bow, where I never was before, and there walked in the fields very pleasant, and sang: and so back again, and stopped and drank at the Gun, at Mile End, and so to the Old Exchange door, and did buy them a pound of cherries, cost me 2<abbr>s.</abbr>, and so set them down again; and I to my little mercer’s Finch, that lives now in the Minories, where I have left my cloak, and did here <i xml:lang="fr">baiser</i> <i xml:lang="es">su moher</i>, a <i xml:lang="fr">belle femme</i>, and there took my cloak which I had left there, and so by water, it being now about nine o’clock, down to Deptford, where I have not been many a day, and there it being dark I did by agreement <i xml:lang="fr">aller à la</i> house <i xml:lang="fr">de</i> Bagwell, and there after a little playing and <i xml:lang="fr">baisando</i> we did go up in the dark <i xml:lang="it">a su camera</i>⁠ ⁠… and to my boat again, and against the tide home. Got there by twelve o’clock, taking into my boat, for company, a man that desired a passage⁠—a certain western bargeman, with whom I had good sport, talking of the old woman of Woolwich,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4080" id="noteref-4080" epub:type="noteref">4080</a> and telling him the whole story.</p>
			</article>
			<article id="entry-1668-6-13" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-06-13">3rd</time>. Up, and to the office, where busy till 9 o’clock, and then to Whitehall, to the Council-chamber, where I did present the Duke of York with an account of the charge of the present fleet, to his satisfaction; and this being done, did ask his leave for my going out of town five or six days, which he did give me, saying, that my diligence in the King’s business was such, that I ought not to be denied when my own business called me any whither. Thence with Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Gawden to Westminster, where I did take a turn or two, and met Roger Pepys, who is mighty earnest for me to stay from going into the country till he goes, and to bring my people thither for some time: but I cannot, but will find another time this summer for it. Thence with him home, and there to the office till noon, and then with Lord Brouncker, Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Minnes, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr> Carteret, upon whose accounts they have been this day to the Three Tuns to dinner, and thence back again home, and after doing a little business I by coach to the King’s house, and there saw good part of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Scornfull Lady</i>, and that done, would have taken out Knepp, but she was engaged, and so to my Lord Crew’s to visit him; from whom I learn nothing but that there hath been some controversy at the Council-table, about my Lord Sandwich’s signing, where some would not have had him, in the treaty with Portugal; but all, I think, is over in it. Thence by coach to Westminster to the Hall, and thence to the Park, where much good company, and many fine ladies; and in so handsome a hackney I was, that I believe Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Coventry and others, who looked on me, did take me to be in one of my own, which I was a little troubled for. So to the lodge, and drank a cup of new milk, and so home, and there to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s, and sat and talked with her, and then home to bed, having laid my business with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer to go out of town Friday next, with hopes of a great deal of pleasure.</p>

			<article id="entry-1668-6-14" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-06-14">4th</time>. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon home to dinner, where <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clerke, the solicitor, dined with me and my clerks. After dinner I carried and set him down at the Temple, he observing to me how <abbr>St.</abbr> Sepulchre’s church steeple is repaired already<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4081" id="noteref-4081" epub:type="noteref">4081</a> a good deal, and the Fleet Bridge is contracted for by the City to begin to be built this summer, which do please me mightily. I to Whitehall, and walked through the Park for a little ayre; and so back to the Council-chamber, to the Committee of the Navy, about the business of fitting the present fleet, suitable to the money given, which, as the King orders it, and by what appears, will be very little; and so as I perceive the Duke of York will have nothing to command, nor can intend to go abroad. But it is pretty to see how careful these great men are to do everything so as they may answer it to the Parliament, thinking themselves safe in nothing but where the judges, with whom they often advise, do say the matter is doubtful; and so they take upon themselves then to be the chief persons to interpret what is doubtful. Thence home, and all the evening to set matters in order against my going to Brampton tomorrow, being resolved upon my journey, and having the Duke of York’s leave again today; though I do plainly see that I can very ill be spared now, there being much business, especially about this, which I have attended the Council about, and I the man that am alone consulted with; and, besides, my Lord Brouncker is at this time ill, and Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn. So things being put in order at the Office, I home to do the like there; and so to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-06-20">10th (Wednesday)</time>. Up, and walked to the Hospitall:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4087" id="noteref-4087" epub:type="noteref">4087</a> very large and fine; and pictures of founders, and the History<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4088" id="noteref-4088" epub:type="noteref">4088</a> of the Hospitall; and is said to be worth £700 per annum; and that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Foly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4089" id="noteref-4089" epub:type="noteref">4089</a> was here lately to see how their lands were settled; and here, in old English, the story of the occasion of it, and a rebus at the bottom.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4090" id="noteref-4090" epub:type="noteref">4090</a> So did give the poor, which they would not take but in their box, 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> So to the inn, and paid the reckoning and whatnot, 13<abbr>s.</abbr> So forth towards Hungerford, led this good way by our landlord, one Heart, an old but very civil and well-spoken man, more than I ever heard, of his quality. He gone, we forward; and I vexed at my people’s not minding the way. So come to Hungerford, where very good trouts, eels, and crayfish. Dinner: a mean town. At dinner there, 12<abbr>s.</abbr> Thence set out with a guide, who saw us to Newmarket-heath,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4091" id="noteref-4091" epub:type="noteref">4091</a> and then left us, 3<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> So all over the Plain by the sight of the steeple, the Plain high and low, to Salisbury, by night; but before I come to the town, I saw a great fortification, and there ’light, and to it and in it; and find it prodigious, so as to frighten me to be in it all alone at that time of night, it being dark. I understand, since, it to be that, that is called Old Sarum.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4092" id="noteref-4092" epub:type="noteref">4092</a> Come to the George Inne, where lay in a silk bed; and very good diet.

				<p><time datetime="1668-06-21">11th (Thursday)</time>. Up, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer and I up and down the town, and find it a very brave place. The river goes through every street; and a most capacious marketplace. The city great, I think greater than Hereford. But the Minster most admirable;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4093" id="noteref-4093" epub:type="noteref">4093</a> as big, I think, and handsomer than Westminster: and a most large Close about it, and houses for the Officers thereof, and a fine palace for the Bishop. So to my lodging back, and took out my wife and people to show them the town and Church; but they being at prayers, we could not be shown the Quire. A very good organ; and I looked in, and saw the Bishop, my friend <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ward.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4094" id="noteref-4094" epub:type="noteref">4094</a> Thence to the inne; and there not being able to hire coach-horses, and not willing to use our own, we got saddle-horses, very dear. Boy that went to look for them, 6<abbr>d.</abbr> So the three women behind <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer, Murford, and our guide, and I single to Stonage; over the Plain and some great hills, even to fright us. Come thither, and find them as prodigious as any tales I ever heard of them, and worth going this journey to see. God knows what their use was! they are hard to tell, but yet maybe told. Give the shepherd-woman, for leading our horses, 4<abbr>d.</abbr> So back by Wilton, my Lord Pembroke’s house, which we could not see, he being just coming to town; but the situation I do not like, nor the house promise much, it being in a low but rich valley. So back home; and there being ’light, we to the Church, and there find them at prayers again, so could not see the Quire; but I sent the women home, and I did go in, and saw very many fine tombs, and among the rest some very ancient, of the Montagus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4095" id="noteref-4095" epub:type="noteref">4095</a> So home to dinner; and, that being done, paid the reckoning, which was so exorbitant; and particular in rate of my horses, and 7<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> for bread and beer, that I was mad, and resolve to trouble the master about it, and get something for the poor; and come away in that humour: £2 5<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Servants, 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>; poor, 1<abbr>s.</abbr>; guide to the Stones, 2<abbr>s.</abbr>; poor woman in the street, 1<abbr>s.</abbr>; ribbands, 9<abbr>d.</abbr>; washwoman, 1<abbr>s.</abbr>; sempstress for <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer, 3<abbr>s.</abbr>; lent <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer, 3<abbr>s.</abbr> Thence about six o’clock, and with a guide went over the smooth Plain indeed till night; and then by a happy mistake, and that looked like an adventure, we were carried out of our way to a town where we would lie, since we could not go so far as we would. And there with great difficulty come about ten at night to a little inn, where we were fain to go into a room where a pedlar was in bed, and made him rise; and there wife and I lay, and in a truckle-bed Betty Turner and Willett. But good beds, and the master of the house a sober, understanding man, and I had good discourse with him about this country’s matters, as wool, and corne, and other things. And he also merry, and made us mighty merry at supper, about manning the new ship, at Bristol, with none but men whose wives do master them; and it seems it is become in reproach to some men of estate that are such hereabouts, that this is become common talk. By and by to bed, glad of this mistake, because, it seems, had we gone on as we intended, we could not have passed with our coach, and must have lain on the Plain all night. This day from Salisbury I wrote by the post my excuse for not coming home, which I hope will do, for I am resolved to see the Bath, and, it may be, Bristol.</p>

			<article id="entry-1668-6-22" epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">
				<p><time datetime="1668-06-22">12th (Friday)</time>. Up, finding our beds good, but lousy; which made us merry. We set out, the reckoning and servants coming to 9<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>; my guide thither, 2<abbr>s.</abbr>; coachman, advanced, 10<abbr>s.</abbr> So rode a very good way, led to my great content by our landlord to Philips-Norton, with great pleasure, being now come into Somersetshire; where my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> mightily joyed thereat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4096" id="noteref-4096" epub:type="noteref">4096</a> I commending the country, as indeed it deserves. And the first town we came to was Brekington, where, we stopping for something for the horses, we called two or three little boys to us, and pleased ourselves with their manner of speech,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4097" id="noteref-4097" epub:type="noteref">4097</a> and did make one of them kiss <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr>, and another say the Lord’s Prayer (hallowed be thy kingdom come). At Philips-Norton I walked to the Church, and there saw a very ancient tomb of some Knight Templar, I think; and here saw the tombstone whereon there were only two heads cut, which, the story goes, and credibly, were two sisters, called the Fair Maids of Foscott,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4098" id="noteref-4098" epub:type="noteref">4098</a> that had two bodies upward and one belly, and there lie buried. Here is also a very fine ring of six bells, and they mighty tuneable. Having dined very well, 10<abbr>s.</abbr>, we come before night to the Bath; where I presently stepped out with my landlord, and saw the baths, with people in them. They are not so large as I expected, but yet pleasant; and the town most of stone, and clean, though the streets generally narrow. I home, and being weary, went to bed without supper; the rest supping.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-06-23">13th (Saturday)</time>. Up at four o’clock, being by appointment called up to the Cross Bath,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4099" id="noteref-4099" epub:type="noteref">4099</a> where we were carried one after one another, myself, and wife, and Betty Turner, Willet, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer. And by and by, though we designed to have done before company come, much company come; very fine ladies; and the manner pretty enough, only methinks it cannot be clean to go so many bodies together in the same water. Good conversation among them that are acquainted here, and stay together. Strange to see how hot the water is; and in some places, though this is the most temperate bath, the springs so hot as the feet not able to endure. But strange to see, when women and men herein, that live all the season in these waters, that cannot but be parboiled, and look like the creatures of the bath! Carried away, wrapped in a sheet, and in a chair, home; and there one after another thus carried, I staying above two hours in the water, home to bed, sweating for an hour; and by and by, comes music to play to me, extraordinary good as ever I heard at London almost, or anywhere: 5<abbr>s.</abbr> Up, to go to Bristol, about eleven o’clock, and paying my landlord that was our guide from Chiltern, 10<abbr>s.</abbr>, and the serjeant of the bath, 10<abbr>s.</abbr>, and the man that carried us in chairs, 3<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Set out towards Bristoll, and come thither (in a coach hired to spare our own horses); the way bad, but country good, about two o’clock, where set down at the Horse-shoe, and there, being trimmed by a very handsome fellow, 2<abbr>s.</abbr>, walked with my wife and people through the city, which is in every respect another London, that one can hardly know it, to stand in the country, no more than that. No carts, it standing generally on vaults, only dogcarts.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4100" id="noteref-4100" epub:type="noteref">4100</a> So to the Three Crowns Tavern I was directed; but, when I come in, the master told me that he had newly given over the selling of wine; it seems, grown rich; and so went to the Sun; and there <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> going with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Hewer and Betty Turner to see her uncle [Butts], and leaving my wife with the mistress of the house, I to see the quay, which is a most large and noble place; and to see the new ship building by Bally,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4101" id="noteref-4101" epub:type="noteref">4101</a> neither he nor Furzer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4102" id="noteref-4102" epub:type="noteref">4102</a> being in town. It will be a fine ship. Spoke with the foreman, and did give the boys that kept the cabin 2<abbr>s.</abbr> Walked back to the Sun, where I find <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> come back, and with her, her uncle, a sober merchant, very good company, and so like one of our sober, wealthy, London merchants, as pleased me mightily. Here we dined, and much good talk with him, 7<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>: a messenger to Sir John Knight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4103" id="noteref-4103" epub:type="noteref">4103</a> who was not at home, 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Then walked with him [Butts] and my wife and company round the quay, and to the ship; and he showed me the Customhouse, and made me understand many things of the place, and led us through Marsh Street, where our girl was born. But, Lord! the joy that was among the old poor people of the place, to see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Willet’s daughter, it seems her mother being a brave woman and mightily beloved! And so brought us a back way by surprise to his house, where a substantial good house, and well furnished; and did give us good entertainment of strawberries, a whole venison-pasty, cold, and plenty of brave wine, and above all Bristoll milk,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4104" id="noteref-4104" epub:type="noteref">4104</a> where comes in another poor woman, who, hearing that <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> was here, did come running hither, and with her eyes so full of tears, and heart so full of joy, that she could not speak when she come in, that it made me weep too: I protest that I was not able to speak to her, which I would have done, to have diverted her tears. His wife a good woman, and so sober and substantiall as I was never more pleased anywhere.

He showed us the place where the merchants meet here, and a fine Cross yet standing, like Cheapside. And so to the Horseshoe, where paid the reckoning, 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> We back, and by moonshine to the Bath again, about ten-o’clock: bad way; and giving the coachman 1<abbr>s.</abbr>, went all of us to bed.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-06-24">14th (Sunday)</time>. Up, and walked up and down the town, and saw a pretty good marketplace, and many good streets, and very fair stone-houses. And so to the great Church,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4105" id="noteref-4105" epub:type="noteref">4105</a> and there saw Bishop Montagu’s tomb;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4106" id="noteref-4106" epub:type="noteref">4106</a> and, when placed, did there see many brave people come, and, among others, two men brought in, in litters, and set down in the chancel to hear: but I did not know one face. Here a good organ; but a vain, pragmatical fellow preached a ridiculous, affected sermon, that made me angry, and some gentlemen that sat next me, and sang well. So home, walking round the walls of the City, which are good, and the battlements all whole. The sexton of the church 1<abbr>s.</abbr> So home to dinner, and after dinner comes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Butts again to see me, and he and I to church, where the same idle fellow preached; and I slept most of the sermon. Thence home, and took my wife out and the girls, and come to this church again, to see it, and look over the monuments, where, among others, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Venner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4107" id="noteref-4107" epub:type="noteref">4107</a> and Pelling,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4108" id="noteref-4108" epub:type="noteref">4108</a> and a lady of Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Waller’s;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4109" id="noteref-4109" epub:type="noteref">4109</a> he lying with his face broken. So to the fields a little and walked, and then home and had my head looked [at], and so to supper, and then comes my landlord to me, a sober understanding man, and did give me a good account of the antiquity of this town and Wells; and of two Heads, on two pillars, in Wells church. But he a Catholick. So he gone, I to bed.</p>

Up, and with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Butts to look into the baths, and find the King and Queen’s full of a mixed sort, of good and bad, and the Cross only almost for the gentry. So home and did the like with my wife, and did pay my guides, two women, 5<abbr>s.</abbr>; one man, 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>; poor, 6<abbr>d.</abbr>; woman to lay my foot-cloth, 1<abbr>s.</abbr> So to our inne, and there eat and paid reckoning, £1 8<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>; servants, 3<abbr>s.</abbr>; poor, 1<abbr>s.</abbr>; lent the coach man, 10<abbr class="eoc">s.</abbr> Before I took coach, I went to make a boy dive in the King’s bath, 1<abbr class="eoc">s.</abbr> I paid also for my coach and a horse to Bristol, £1 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr class="eoc">d.</abbr> Took coach, and away, without any of the company of the other stagecoaches, that go out of this town today; and rode all day with some trouble, for fear of being out of our way, over the Downes, where the life of the shepherds is, in fair weather only, pretty. In the afternoon come to Avebury,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4110" id="noteref-4110" epub:type="noteref">4110</a> where, seeing great stones like those of Stonage standing up, I stopped, and took a countryman of that town, and he carried me and showed me a place trenched in,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4111" id="noteref-4111" epub:type="noteref">4111</a> like Old Sarum almost, with great stones pitched in it, some bigger than those at Stonage in figure, to my great admiration: and he told me that most people of learning, coming by, do come and view them, and that the King did so: and that the Mount cast hard by is called Selbury,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4112" id="noteref-4112" epub:type="noteref">4112</a> from one King Seall buried there, as tradition says. I did give this man 1<abbr>s.</abbr> So took coach again, seeing one place with great high stones pitched round, which, I believe, was once some particular building, in some measure like that of Stonage. But, about a mile off, it was prodigious to see how full the Downes are of great stones; and all along the vallies, stones of considerable bigness, most of them growing certainly out of the ground so thick as to cover the ground, which makes me think the less of the wonder of Stonage, for hence they might undoubtedly supply themselves with stones, as well as those at Avebury. In my way did give to the poor and menders of the highway 3<abbr class="eoc">s.</abbr> Before night, come to Marlborough, and lay at the Hart; a good house, and a pretty fair town for a street or two; and what is most singular is, their houses on one side having their penthouses supported with pillars, which makes it a good walk. My wife pleased with all, this evening reading of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Mustapha</i> to me till supper, and then to supper, and had music whose innocence pleased me, and I did give them 3<abbr class="eoc">s.</abbr> So to bed, and lay well all night, and long, so as all the five coaches that come this day from Bath, as well as we, were gone out of the town before six.</p>

Somewhat out of humour all day, reflecting on my wife’s neglect of things, and impertinent humour got by this liberty of being from me, which she is never to be trusted with; for she is a fool. Thence pleasant way to London, before night, and find all very well, to great content; and there to talk with my wife, and saw Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who is well again. I hear of the ill news by the great fire at Barbados. By and by home, and there with my people to supper, all in pretty good humour, though I find my wife hath something in her gizzard, that only waits an opportunity of being provoked to bring up; but I will not, for my content-sake, give it.

Up betimes and to the office, there to set my papers in order and books, my office having been new whited and windows made clean, and so to sit, where all the morning, and did receive a hint or two from my Lord Anglesey, as if he thought much of my taking the ayre as I have done; but I care not a turd; but whatever the matter is, I think he hath some ill-will to me, or at least an opinion that I am more the servant of the Board than I am. At noon home to dinner, where my wife still in a melancholy, fusty humour, and crying, and do not tell me plainly what it is; but I by little words find that she hath heard of my going to plays, and carrying people abroad every day, in her absence; and that I cannot help but the storm will break out, I think, in a little time. After dinner carried her by coach to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s, where she sat in the coach till I to my Lady Peterborough’s, who tells me, among other things, her Lord’s good words to the Duke of York lately, about my Lord Sandwich, and that the Duke of York is kind to my Lord Sandwich, which I am glad to hear: my business here was about her Lord’s pension from Tangier. Here met with Povy, who tells me how hard Creed is upon him, though he did give him, about six months since, I think he said, fifty pieces in gold; and one thing there is in his accounts that I fear may touch me, but I shall help it, I hope. So my wife not speaking a word, going nor coming, nor willing to go to a play, though a new one, I to the Office, and did much business. At night home, where supped <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Turner and his wife, and Betty and Mercer and Pelling, as merry as the ill, melancholy humour that my wife was in, would let us, which vexed me; but I took no notice of it, thinking that will be the best way, and let it wear away itself. After supper, parted, and to bed; and my wife troubled all night, and about one o’clock goes out of the bed to the girl’s bed, which did trouble me, she crying and sobbing, without telling the cause. By and by she comes back to me, and still crying; I then rose, and would have sat up all night, but she would have me come to bed again; and being pretty well pacified, we to sleep.</p>

				<p><time datetime="1668-06-29">19th</time>. When between two and three in the morning we were waked with my maids crying out, “Fire, fire, in Mark Lane!” So I rose and looked out, and it was dreadful; and strange apprehensions in me, and us all, of being presently burnt. So we all rose; and my care presently was to secure my gold, and plate, and papers, and could quickly have done it, but I went forth to see where it was; and the whole town was presently in the streets; and I found it in a new-built house that stood alone in Minchin-lane, over against the Cloth-workers’-hall, which burned furiously: the house not yet quite finished; and the benefit of brick was well seen, for it burnt all inward, and fell down within itself; so no fear of doing more hurt. So homeward, and stopped at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mills’s, where he and she at the door, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner, and Betty, and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hollworthy, and there I stayed and talked, and up to the church leads, and saw the fire, which spent itself, till all fear over. I home, and there we to bed again, and slept pretty well, and about nine rose, and then my wife fell into her blubbering again, and at length had a request to make to me, which was, that she might go into France, and live there, out of trouble; and then all come out, that I loved pleasure and denied her any, and a deal of do; and I find that there have been great fallings out between my father and her, whom, forever hereafter, I must keep asunder, for they cannot possibly agree. And I said nothing, but, with very mild words and few, suffered her humour to spend, till we begun to be very quiet, and I think all will be over, and friends, and so I to the office, where all the morning doing business. Yesterday I heard how my Lord Ashly is like to die, having some imposthume in his breast, that he hath been fain to be cut into the body.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4120" id="noteref-4120" epub:type="noteref">4120</a> At noon home to dinner, and thence by coach to Whitehall, where we attended the Duke of York in his closet, upon our usual business. And thence out, and did see many of the Knights of the Garter, with the King and Duke of York, going into the Privychamber, to elect the Elector of Saxony<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4121" id="noteref-4121" epub:type="noteref">4121</a> into that Order, who, I did hear the Duke of York say, was a good drinker: I know not upon what score this compliment is done him. Thence with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Penn, who is in great pain of the gowte, by coach round by Holborne home, he being at every kennel full of pain. Thence home, and by and by comes my wife and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Deb.</abbr> home, have been at the King’s playhouse today, thinking to spy me there; and saw the new play, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Evening Love</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4122" id="noteref-4122" epub:type="noteref">4122</a> of Dryden’s, which, though the world commends, she likes not.

So she to Unthanke’s and I to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Povy, and there settled some business; and here talked of things, and he thinks there will be great revolutions, and that Creed will be a great man, though a rogue, he being a man of the old strain, which will now be up again. So I took coach, and set Povy down at Charing Cross, and took my wife up, and calling at the New Exchange at Smith’s shop, and kissed her pretty hand, and so we home, and there able to do nothing by candlelight, my eyes being now constantly so bad that I must take present advice or be blind. So to supper, grieved for my eyes, and to bed.</p>
