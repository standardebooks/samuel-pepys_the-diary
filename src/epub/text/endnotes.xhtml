					<p>Pepys tells us (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 31st, 1664) that his father and mother were married at Newington in Surrey, on October 15th, 1626, but although the register of marriages of <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary, Newington, has been searched, the certificate of the marriage has not been found, and the maiden name of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> John Pepys is still unknown. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Osmund Airy suggests, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, the possibility that her maiden name may have been Perkins, and refers to an uncle and aunt Perkins who lived in poverty in the Fens near Wisbeach. I believe, however, that these Perkins were connections on the father’s rather than on the mother’s side. Jane Pepys, youngest sister of Samuel’s father, married Perkin. The suggestion, nevertheless, is useful, as it draws attention to the possibility of some of the cousins and aunts to whom we can find no clue, having been relations on the mother’s side. <a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He was then clerk in Chatham Dockyard, and in 1674 “he went as junior clerk⁠ ⁠… under <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hewer,” and afterwards chief or head-clerk under Pepys, to whom he is said to have been devoted. He was examined before a Committee of the House of Lords, and several times remanded back to Newgate touching the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey. He was eventually acquitted, and having influential friends he subsequently obtained several good appointments. He was a Commissioner of the Navy from 1694 to 1702, and in 1700 he was one of five Commissioners appointed by the House of Lords to state the accounts due to the Army. He died in 1706.

					<p>The year did not legally begin in England before the 25th March until the act for altering the style fixed the 1st of January as the first day of the year, and previous to 1752 the year extended from March 25th to the following March 24th. Thus since 1752 we have been in the habit of putting the two dates for the months of January and February and March 1 to 24⁠—in all years previous to 1752. Practically, however, many persons considered the year to commence with January 1st, as it will be seen Pepys did. The 1st of January was considered as New Year’s day long before Pepys’s time.

					<p>John Lambert, major-general in the Parliamentary army. The title Lord was not his by right, but it was frequently given to the republican officers. He was born in 1619, at Calton Hall, in the parish of Kirkby-in-Malham-Dale, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1642 he was appointed captain of horse under Fairfax, and acted as major-general to Cromwell in 1650 during the war in Scotland. After this Parliament conferred on him a grant of lands in Scotland worth £1,000 per annum. He refused to take the oath of allegiance to Cromwell, for which the Protector deprived him of his commission. After Cromwell’s death he tried to set up a military government. The Commons cashiered Lambert, Desborough, and other officers, October 12th, 1659, but Lambert retaliated by thrusting out the Commons, and set out to meet Monk. His men fell away from him, and he was sent to the Tower, March 3rd, 1660, but escaped. In 1662 he was tried on a charge of high treason and condemned, but his life was spared. It is generally stated that he passed the remainder of his life in the island of Guernsey, but this is proved to be incorrect by a <abbr>MS.</abbr> in the Plymouth Athenaeum, entitled “Plimmouth Memoirs collected by James Yonge, 1684” This will be seen from the following extracts quoted by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.

					<p>George Downing was one of the Four Tellers of the Receipt of the Exchequer, and in his office Pepys was a clerk. He was the son of Emmanuel Downing of the Inner Temple, afterwards of Salem, Massachusetts, and of Lucy, sister of Governor John Winthrop. He is supposed to have been born in August, 1623. He and his parents went to New England in 1638, and he was the second graduate of Harvard College. He returned to England about 1645, and acted as Colonel Okey’s chaplain before he entered into political life. Anthony a Wood (who incorrectly describes him as the son of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Calybute Downing, vicar of Hackney) calls Downing a sider with all times and changes: skilled in the common cant, and a preacher occasionally. He was sent by Cromwell to Holland in 1657, as resident there. At the Restoration, he espoused the King’s cause, and was knighted and elected <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">M.P.</abbr> for Morpeth, in 1661. Afterwards, becoming Secretary to the Treasury and Commissioner of the Customs, he was in 1663 created a Baronet of East Hatley, in Cambridgeshire, and was again sent Ambassador to Holland. His grandson of the same name, who died in 1749, was the founder of Downing College, Cambridge. The title became extinct in 1764, upon the decease of Sir John Gerrard Downing, the last heir-male of the family.

						<p>“<abbr>Jan.</abbr> 17th, 1659. The Earl of Chesterfield and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Woolly’s son of Hammersmith, had a quarrel about a mare of eighteen pounds price; the quarrel would not be reconciled, insomuch that a challenge passed between them. They fought a duel on the backside of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Colby’s house at Kensington, where the Earl and he had several passes. The Earl wounded him in two places, and would fain have then ended, but the stubbornness and pride of heart of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Woolly would not give over, and the next pass [he] was killed on the spot. The Earl fled to Chelsea, and there took water and escaped. The jury found it chance-medley.”</p>

					<p>Sir Winston Churchill also observes (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Divi Britannici</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 340) that James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> was no more troubled at his querulous countrymen robbing him than a bridegroom at the losing of his points and garters. Lady Fanshawe, in her “Memoirs,” says, that at the nuptials of Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> and the Infanta, “the Bishop of London declared them married in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and then they caused the ribbons her Majesty wore to be cut in little pieces; and as far as they would go, everyone had some.” The practice still survives in the form of wedding favours.</p>
					<p>A similar custom is still of every day’s occurrence at Dieppe. Upon the morrow after their marriage, the bride and bridegroom perambulate the streets, followed by a numerous cortege, the guests at the wedding festival, two and two; each individual wearing two bits of narrow ribbon, about two inches in length, of different colours, which are pinned crossways upon the breast. These morsels of ribbons originally formed the garters of the bride and bridegroom, which had been divided amidst boisterous mirth among the assembled company, the moment the happy pair had been formally installed in the bridal bed.⁠—<abbr>Ex. inf.</abbr> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> William Hughes, Belvedere, Jersey. <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-156" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The manner of the escape of John Lambert, out of the Tower, on the 11th <abbr>inst.</abbr>, as related by Rugge:⁠—“That about eight of the clock at night he escaped by a rope tied fast to his window, by which he slid down, and in each hand he had a handkerchief; and six men were ready to receive him, who had a barge to hasten him away. She who made the bed, being privy to his escape, that night, to blind the warder when he came to lock the chamber-door, went to bed, and possessed Colonel Lambert’s place, and put on his nightcap. So, when the said warder came to lock the door, according to his usual manner, he found the curtains drawn, and conceiving it to be Colonel John Lambert, he said, ‘Good night, my Lord.’ To which a seeming voice replied, and prevented all further jealousies. The next morning, on coming to unlock the door, and espying her face, he cried out, ‘In the name of God, Joan, what makes you here? Where is my Lord Lambert?’ She said, ‘He is gone; but I cannot tell whither.’ Whereupon he caused her to rise, and carried her before the officer in the Tower, and [she] was committed to custody. Some said that a lady knit for him a garter of silk, by which he was conveyed down, and that she received £100 for her pains.” <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <a href="chapter-4.xhtml#noteref-360" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Samuel Morland, son of the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Thomas Morland, of Sulhamstead Banister, near Reading, Berks, was born about 1625. He was educated at Winchester School, whence he removed to Magdalene College, Cambridge; admitted to a scholarship, July 8th, 1645; to a quinquennial fellowship, November 30th, 1649; and to a foundation fellowship, September 24th, 1651. One of the fellows who signed Pepys’s admission entry, October 1st, 1650. He became afterwards one of Thurloe’s undersecretaries, and was employed in several embassies, particularly to the Vaudois, by Cromwell, whose interests he betrayed, by secretly communicating with Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. He published in 1658, in a folio volume, his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piemont</i>. He was knighted at Breda, and afterwards created a baronet. He was an ingenious mechanic, and made some improvements in the steam engine.

He died December 30th, 1695, and was buried in Hammersmith church on the 6th of the following January. His <abbr>MSS.</abbr> are at Cambridge, in the Public Library.</p>

					<p>William Coventry, to whom Pepys became so warmly attached afterwards, was the fourth son of Thomas, first Lord Coventry, the Lord Keeper. He was born in 1628, and entered at Queen’s College, Oxford, in 1642; after the Restoration he became private secretary to the Duke of York, his commission as Secretary to the Lord High Admiral not being conferred until 1664; elected <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">M.P.</abbr> for Great Yarmouth in 1661. In 1662 he was appointed an extra Commissioner of the Navy, an office he held until 1667; in 1665, knighted and sworn a Privy Councillor, and, in 1667, constituted a Commissioner of the Treasury; but, having been forbid the court on account of his challenging the Duke of Buckingham, he retired into the country, nor could he subsequently be prevailed upon to accept of any official employment. Burnet calls Sir William Coventry the best speaker in the House of Commons, and “a man of the finest and best temper that belonged to the court,” and Pepys never omits an opportunity of paying a tribute to his public and private worth.

						<p>“About midnight arrived there <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Downing, who did the affairs of England to the Lords the Estates, in quality of Resident under Oliver Cromwell, and afterward under the pretended Parliament, which having changed the form of the government, after having cast forth the last Protector, had continued him in his imploiment, under the quality of Extraordinary Envoy. He began to have respect for the King’s person, when he knew that all England declared for a free parliament, and departed from Holland without order, as soon as he understood that there was nothing that could longer oppose the reestablishment of monarchal government, with a design to crave letters of recommendation to General Monk. This lord considered him, as well because of the birth of his wife, which is illustrious, as because Downing had expressed some respect for him in a time when that eminent person could not yet discover his intentions. He had his letters when he arrived at midnight at the house of the Spanish Embassador, as we have said. He presented them forthwith to the King, who arose from table a while after, read the letters, receiv’d the submissions of Downing, and granted him the pardon and grace which he asked for him to whom he could deny nothing. Some daies after the King knighted him, and would it should be believed, that the strong aversions which this minister of the Protector had made appear against him on all occasions, and with all sorts of persons indifferently, even a few daies before the public and general declaration of all England, proceeded not from any evil intention, but only from a deep dissimulation, wherewith he was constrained to cover his true sentiments, for fear to prejudice the affairs of his Majesty.”</p>

					<p>On Saturday, October 11th, 1651, Colonel Gunter made an agreement at Chichester with Nicholas Tettersell, through Francis Mansell (a French merchant), to have Tettersell’s vessel ready at an hour’s warning.

So when we came to the inn at Brighthelmstone we met with one, the merchant [Francis Mansell] who had hired the vessel, in company with her master [Tettersell], the merchant only knowing me, as having hired her only to carry over a person of quality that was escaped from the battle of Worcester without naming anybody.”</p>

The following year, while Vice-Admiral to the Earl of Warwick, he chased a Dutch man-of-war into Burlington Bay, knowing that Queen Henrietta Maria was on board; and then, learning that she had landed and was lodged on the quay, he fired above a hundred shot upon the house, some of which passing through her majesty’s chamber, she was obliged, though indisposed, to retire for safety into the open fields.

					<p>This ceremony is usually traced to Edward the Confessor, but there is no direct evidence of the early Norman kings having touched for the evil. Sir John Fortescue, in his defence of the House of Lancaster against that of York, argued that the crown could not descend to a female, because the Queen is not qualified by the form of anointing her, used at the coronation, to cure the disease called the King’s evil. Burn asserts, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Parish Registers</i>, 1862, <abbr>p.</abbr> 179, that “between 1660 and 1682, 92,107 persons were touched for the evil.” Everyone coming to the court for that purpose, brought a certificate signed by the minister and churchwardens, that he had not at any time been touched by His Majesty. The practice was supposed to have expired with the Stuarts, but the point being disputed, reference was made to the library of the Duke of Sussex, and four several Oxford editions of the Book of Common Prayer were found, all printed after the accession of the house of Hanover, and all containing, as an integral part of the service, “The Office for the Healing.” The stamp of gold with which the King crossed the sore of the sick person was called an angel, and of the value of ten shillings. It had a hole bored through it, through which a ribbon was drawn, and the angel was hanged about the patient’s neck till the cure was perfected.

He certainly judged right. The honour of the Mitre was much eclipsed through the loss of so good a parent of the church of England.

Daniel was father of Sir Thomas Rawlinson, of whom Thomas Hearne writes (October 1st, 1705): “Sir Thomas Rawlinson is chosen Lord Mayor of London for y<sup>e</sup> ensueing notwithstanding the great opposition of y<sup>e</sup> Whigg party” (Hearne’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Collections</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> Doble, 1885, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span> <abbr>p.</abbr> 51).

						<p>Some clocks are still made with a small ball, or bullet, on an inclined plane, which turns every minute. The King’s clocks probably dropped bullets. Gainsborough the painter had a brother who was a dissenting minister at Henley-on-Thames, and possessed a strong genius for mechanics. He invented a clock of a very peculiar construction, which, after his death, was deposited in the British Museum. It told the hour by a little bell, and was kept in motion by a leaden bullet, which dropped from a spiral reservoir at the top of the clock, into a little ivory bucket. This was so contrived as to discharge it at the bottom, and by means of a counterweight was carried up to the top of the clock, where it received another bullet, which was discharged as the former. This seems to have been an attempt at the perpetual motion.</p>

					<p>The notorious Thomas Venner, the Fifth-monarchy man, a cooper and preacher to a conventicle in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, with a small following (about fifty in number) took arms on the 6th January for the avowed purpose of establishing the Millennium. He was a violent enthusiast, and persuaded his followers that they were invulnerable. After exciting much alarm in the City, and skirmishing with the Trained Bands, they marched to Caen Wood. They were driven out by a party of guards, but again entered the City, where they were overpowered by the Trained Bands. The men were brought to trial and condemned; four, however, were acquitted and two reprieved. The execution of some of these men is mentioned by Pepys under date January 19th and 21st. “A Relation of the Arraignment and Trial of those who made the late Rebellious Insurrections in London, 1661,” is reprinted in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Somers’ Tracts</i>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">vii</span> (1812), <abbr>p.</abbr> 469. <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-871" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Pepys here refers to the perambulation of parishes on Holy Thursday, still observed. This ceremony was sometimes enlivened by whipping the boys, for the better impressing on their minds the remembrance of the day, and the boundaries of the parish, instead of beating houses or stones. But this would not have harmonized well with the excellent Hooker’s practice on this day, when he “always dropped some loving and facetious observations, to be remembered against the next year, especially by the boys and young people.” Amongst Dorsetshire customs, it seems that, in perambulating a manor or parish, a boy is tossed into a stream, if that be the boundary; if a hedge, a sapling from it is applied for the purpose of flagellation. <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <a href="chapter-17.xhtml#noteref-1075" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Murray and Heath, whose authority is generally good, assert that James Hamilton was at this time Bishop of Galloway; but the commission for his consecration bears date December 12th, 1661. Kennett also mentions Thomas Sydserf, who had been deposed from the see of Galloway by the Presbyterians in 1638, as the only Scotch prelate alive at the Restoration; and adds, that he came up to London, expecting to be advanced to the primacy. But he had so disgusted the English bishops, that he was only removed to the See of Orkney, which, though richly endowed, was considered at all times as a sinecure; and he did not long survive his translation. At all events, Hamilton was his successor, and the Bishop of Galloway mentioned in the Diary, May 15th, 1663. Lingard’s testimony is in favour of Sydserf being the Bishop of Galloway here alluded to.

					<p>This place so often mentioned, was first given up to the English fleet under Lord Sandwich, by the Portuguese, January 30th, 1662; and Lord Peterborough left governor, with a garrison. The greatest pains were afterwards taken to preserve the fortress, and a fine mole was constructed at a vast expense, to improve the harbour. At length, after immense sums of money had been wasted there, the House of Commons expressed a dislike to the management of the garrison, which they suspected to be a nursery for a popish army, and seemed disinclined to maintain it any longer. The king consequently, in 1683, sent Lord Dartmouth to bring home the troops, and destroy the works; which he performed so effectually, that it would puzzle all our engineers to restore the harbour. It were idle to speculate on the benefits which might have accrued to England, by its preservation and retention; Tangier fell into the hands of the Moors, its importance having ceased, with the demolition of the mole. Many curious views of Tangier were taken by Hollar, during its occupation by the English; and his drawings are preserved in the British Museum.

					<p>The courier sent by D’Estrades to Paris, with the news of his discomfiture, arrived at the hotel of the Comte de Brienne (Louis-Henri de Lomenie, who had succeeded his father, Henri-Auguste, as Secretary of State) at eleven at night. Brienne instantly repaired to the king, then at supper with the queen-mother, his own queen, and his brother, Philippe of Anjou (Monsieur); and, requesting Louis to appear composed before the numerous spectators, he told him that the Spanish ambassadors people had cut the traces of his ambassador’s coach, killed two coachmen, and cut the horses’ bridles; and that the Spanish ambassador’s coach had taken precedence of that of D’Estrades, whose own son had also been wounded in the affray. In spite of the caution which he had received, Louis rose up in such agitation, as nearly to overturn the table; seized Brienne by the arm, led him into the queen-mother’s chamber, and bade him read D’Estrade’s despatch. The queen-mother followed in haste. “What is the matter?” said she. “It is,” replied the king, “an attempt to embroil the King of Spain and myself.” The queen-mother begged him to return to the company. “I have supped, madam,” said he, raising his voice. “I will be righted in this affair, or I will declare war against the King of Spain; and I will force him to yield precedence to my ambassadors in every court in Europe.” “Oh, my son!” replied the queen-mother, “break not a peace which has cost me so dear; and remember, that the King of Spain is my brother.” “Leave me, madam,” rejoined Louis, “to hear D’Estrade’s despatch. Return to the table, and let some fruit only be prepared for me.” Anne of Austria having retired, Louis listened to the despatch, and instantly gave his commands to Brienne; which were, in substance, to order the Conde de Fuensaldagna, the Spanish ambassador, to quit France instantly, and to forbid the Marques de las Fuentes, his intended successor, to set foot on the French territory⁠—to recall his commissioners on the boundary question, as well as the Archbishop of Embrun, his ambassador at Madrid⁠—to demand from the King of Spain an apology proportionable to the offence; that De Batteville should be punished in person; and that in all the courts of Europe the Spanish ambassador should give place to the French; and, on the refusal of any part of his demands, to declare war. Louis gained all and every point. After much paper war, and many protocols, Spain gave way. The Baron de Batteville was recalled; the Marques de las Fuentes was sent ambassador extraordinary to Paris, to tender apologies; and on March 24th, 1662, in the presence of twenty-seven ambassadors and envoys from various courts of Europe, the Marques de las Fuentes declared to Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span> that the king, his master, had sent orders to all his ambassadors and ministers to abstain from all rivalry with those of Louis. Louis, turning to the foreign ministers, desired them to communicate this declaration to their masters. The Dutch ambassador drily remarked, that he had heard of embassies to tender obedience to the Pope, but that he had never before known of such from one prince to another. An amusing volume might be written on the absurd punctilios of the ambassadors of the seventeenth century. A medal was struck by the French to commemorate this great event. <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-1208" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>And that, too, in the river Thames itself. The right of obliging ships of all nations to lower topsails, and strike their flag to the English, whilst in the British seas, and even on the French coasts, had, up to this time, been rigidly enforced. When Sully was sent by Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, in 1603, to congratulate James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> on his accession, and in a ship commanded by a vice-admiral of France, he was fired upon by the English Admiral Mansel, for daring to hoist the flag of France in the presence of that of England, although within sight of Calais. The French flag was lowered, and all Sully’s remonstrances could obtain no redress for the alleged injury. According to Rugge, Holmes had insisted upon the Swede’s lowering his flag, and had even fired a shot to enforce the observance of the usual tribute of respect, but the ambassador sent his secretary and another gentleman on board the English frigate, to assure the captain, <em>upon the word and honour of an ambassador</em>, that the king, by a verbal order, had given him leave and a dispensation in that particular, and upon this false representation he was allowed to proceed on his voyage without further question. This want of caution, and disobedience of orders, fell heavily on Holmes, who was imprisoned for two months, and not re-appointed to the same ship. Brahé afterwards made a proper submission for the fault he had committed, at his own court.

The arrival of my wife, who I expect some time this month, and the necessity of my own being out of town to meet her, and to stay some time before she comes hither, makes it very necessary that the Parliament be adjourned before Easter, to meet again in the winter.⁠ ⁠… The mention of my wife’s arrival puts me in mind to desire you to put that compliment upon her, that her entrance into the town may be with more decency than the ways will now suffer it to be; and, to that purpose, I pray you would quickly pass such laws as are before you, in order to the amending those ways, and that she may not find Whitehall surrounded with water.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Here lies the Body of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Daniel O’Neale, who descended from that great, honoura<sup>ble</sup> and antient family of the O’Neales, in Ireland, to whom he added new lustre by his own merit, being rewarded for his courage and loyalty in the civil wars, under King Charles the First and Charles the Second, w<sup>th</sup> the offices of Postmaster General of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Master of the Powder, and Groome of His Maj<sup>tyes</sup> Bedchamber. He was married to the right honourable Katherine Countesse of Chesterfield, who erected him this monument, as one of the last markes of her kindness, to show her affection longer than her weak breath would serve to express it. He died <abbr epub:type="se:era">A.D.</abbr> 1663, aged 60.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>This date must be incorrect, as Pepys records O’Neille’s death on October 24th, 1664, and is corroborated in his statement by a letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Ed.</abbr> Savage to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Sancroft (<abbr>Harl.</abbr> <abbr>MS.</abbr> 3785, <abbr>fol.</abbr> 19).

Sir William Hicks died in 1680, and on his monument in Leyton Church he is represented in a recumbent position, holding a baton in his hand as Lieutenant of Waltham Forest.

He speaks of it in good faith, and his term, mystery, simply implies his ignorance of the art of measuring. With regard to Sir William Warren, the case was probably different: he made large presents to Pepys, and confesses that he perjured himself before the Committee of the House of Commons, in concealing the fact.

He was also First Treasurer for Tangier, which office he resigned to Pepys. Povy, had apartments at Whitehall, besides his lodgings in Lincoln’s Inn, and a villa near Hounslow, called the Priory, which he had inherited from Justinian Povy, who purchased it in 1625. He was one of the sons of Justinian Povy, Auditor-General to Queen Anne of Denmark in 1614, whose father was John Povy, citizen and embroiderer of London. Justinian obtained a grant of arms: sable, a bend engrailed between six cinquefoils, or with an annulet for difference. Thomas Povy had two brothers⁠—Richard, who was Commissioner-General of Provisions at Jamaica; and William, Provost-Marshal at Barbados.

Subsequently the remaining three millions were reduced to 2,500,000 to be paid at Paris, and 254,000 in London. It is not known that Clarendon suggested the sale of Dunkirk, but it is certain that he adopted the measure with zeal.

Roch Castle was taken and burnt by the Parliamentary forces in 1644, and Lucy was in London in 1648, where she made the acquaintance of Colonel Algernon Sidney. She then fell into the possession of his brother, Colonel Robert Sidney. In September of this same year she was taken up by Charles, Prince of Wales. Charles terminated his connection with her on October 30th, 1651, and she died in 1658, as appears by a document (administration entry in the Register of the Prerogative Court) met with by the late Colonel Chester. William Erskine, who had served Charles as cupbearer in his wanderings, and was appointed Master of the Charterhouse in December, 1677, had the care of Lucy Walter, and buried her in Paris. He declared that the king never had any intention of marrying her, and she did not deserve it. Thomas Ross, the tutor of her son, put the idea of this claim into his head, and asked <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Cosin to certify to a marriage.

He writes, “The hammer was still retained for coining in the Mint in the Tower of London, but the question of the adoption of the screw-press by the Moneyers appears to have been revived in 1649, when the Council of State had it represented to them that the coins of the Government might be more perfectly and beautifully done, and made equal to any coins in Europe. It was proposed to send to France for Peter Blondeau, who had invented and improved a machine and method for making all coins ‘with the most beautiful polish and equality on the edge, or with any proper inscription or graining.’ He came on the 3rd of September, and although a Committee of the Mint reported in favour of his method of coining, the Company of Moneyers, who appear to have boasted of the success of their predecessors in opposing the introduction of the mill and screw-press in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, prevented the introduction of the machinery, and consequently he did not produce pattern pieces until 1653.⁠ ⁠… It is certain that Blondeau did not invent, but only improved the method of coining by the screw-press, and I believe his improvements related chiefly to a method for ‘rounding the pieces before they are sized, and in making the edges of the moneys with letters and graining,’ which he undertook to reveal to the king. Special stress is laid on the engines wherewith the rims were marked, ‘which might be kept secret among few men.’ I cannot find that there is any record in the Paris mint of Blondeau’s employment there, and the only reference to his invention in the Mint records of this country refers to the ‘collars,’ or perforated discs of metal surrounding the ‘blank’ while it was struck into a coin. There is, however, in the British Museum a <abbr>MS.</abbr> believed to be in Blondeau’s hand, in which he claims his process, ‘as a new invention, to make a handsome coyne, than can be found in all the world besides, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, that shall not only be stamped on both flat sides, but shall even be marked with letters on the thickness of the brim.’ The letters were raised. The press Blondeau used was, I believe, the ordinary screw-press, and I suppose that the presses drawn in Akerman’s well-known plate of the coining-room of the Mint in the Tower, published in 1803 [<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Microcosm of London</i>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 202], if not actually the same machines, were similar to those erected in 1661⁠–⁠62 by Sir William Parkhurst and Sir Anthony <abbr>St.</abbr> Leger, wardens of the Mint, at a cost of £1,400, Professor Roberts-Austen shows that Benvenuto Cellini used a similar press to that attributed to Blondeau, and he gives an illustration of this in his lecture (<abbr>p.</abbr> 810). In a letter to the editor the professor writes: “Pepys’s account of the operations of coining, and especially of assaying gold and silver, is very interesting and singularly accurate considering that he could not have had technical knowledge of the subject.” <a href="chapter-41.xhtml#noteref-1792" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

At last, as they grew warmer, Sedley stood forth naked, and harangued the populace in such profane language, that the public indignation was awakened; the crowd attempted to force the door, and being repulsed, drove in the performers with stones, and broke the windows of the house. For this misdemeanour they were indicted, and Sedley was fined five hundred pounds; what was the sentence of the others is not known. Sedley employed [Henry] Killigrew and another to procure a remission from the King, but (mark the friendship of the dissolute!) they begged the fine for themselves, and exacted it to the last groat.” The woman known as Oxford Kate appears to have kept the notorious Cock Tavern in Bow Street at this date. <a href="chapter-43.xhtml#noteref-1851" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

It contains three hundred lines, and is too long and too scurrilous and worthless to print. “Petty,” observes Lodge (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Peerage of Ireland</i>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 352), “in 1663 raised his reputation still higher, by the success of his invention of the double-bottomed ship, against the judgment of all mankind. Thomas, Earl of Ossory, and other persons of honour, embarked on board this ship, which promised to excel all others in sailing, carriage, and security; but she was at last lost in a dreadful tempest, which overwhelmed a great fleet the same night.” Petty gave a model of his vessel to the Royal Society. <a href="chapter-43.xhtml#noteref-1895" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>All researches after the plan of Lisbon, made for Lord Sandwich, had, until very lately, proved fruitless. A copy, however, has been discovered by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carpenter, of the British Museum, at the country house of a friend of his, and it has since been purchased for the print room of the museum. The impression is one of those taken off on white satin, at Pepys’s suggestion, but the engraver is the well-known Dirk Stoop; the passage in the Diary probably should be read: “It ought to have been better done than by jobbing.” The title agrees verbally with that given by Pepys, and the engraving contains not only Lord Sandwich’s arms, but also his portrait; he is represented as holding a measuring rod, which marks the scale of miles. In spite of Pepys’s opinion, it may be considered a fine specimen of the artist’s skill; its rarity is very great it is not mentioned in any list of Stoop’s works, nor was it known to collectors. Neither the Pepysian, nor the Royal nor the Museum collections possessed it. Lord Sandwich probably made presents only of the impressions.</p>
					<p>Dirk Stoop, who came to England in the suite of Catherine of Braganza, in the capacity of court painter, designed and etched a series of plates, descriptive of the ceremonials and pageants which took place on her marriage. Each etching is 1 foot 10 inches by 7 inches. A complete set is very rare; the British Museum collection, however, possesses them.</p>

The sword is certainly of sixteenth century date, and is very possibly that bought in 1554, if it be not that “verye goodly sworde” given by Sir Ralph Warren in 1545. “It has long been the custom in the City as in other places to have a sword painted black and devoid of ornament, which is carried before the Lord Mayor on occasions of mourning or special solemnity.⁠ ⁠… The present mourning sword has an old blade, but the hilt and guard, which are of iron japanned black, are of the most ordinary character and seemingly modern.

					<p>Professor Silvanus <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P.</abbr> Thompson, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">F.R.S.</abbr>, has kindly supplied me with the following interesting note on the terrella (or terella):</p>
					<p>The name given by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> William Gilbert, author of the famous treatise, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.paper">De Magnete</i> (<abbr>Lond.</abbr> 1600), to a spherical loadstone, on account of its acting as a model, magnetically, of the earth; compass-needles pointing to its poles, as mariners’ compasses do to the poles of the earth. The term was adopted by other writers who followed Gilbert, as the following passage from <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Wm.</abbr> Barlowe’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Magneticall Advertisements</i> (<abbr>Lond.</abbr> 1616) shows: “Wherefore the round <em>Loadstone</em> is significantly termed by <abbr>Doct.</abbr> Gilbert <em>Terrella</em>, that is, a little, or rather a very little Earth: For it representeth in an exceeding small model (as it were) the admirable properties magneticall of the huge Globe of the earth” (<i xml:lang="la"><abbr>op. cit.</abbr></i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 55).</p>
					<p>Gilbert set great store by his invention of the terrella, since it led him to propound the true theory of the mariners’ compass. In his portrait of himself which he had painted for the University of Oxford he was represented as holding in his hand a globe inscribed <em>terella</em>. In the Galileo Museum in Florence there is a terrella twenty-seven inches in diameter, of loadstone from Elba, constructed for Cosmo de’ Medici. A smaller one contrived by Sir Christopher Wren was long preserved in the museum of the Royal Society (Grew’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rarities Belonging to the Royal Society</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 364). Evelyn was shown “a pretty terrella described with all y<sup>e</sup> circles and skewing all y<sup>e</sup> magnetic deviations” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, July 3rd, 1655). <a href="chapter-46.xhtml#noteref-1942" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Silas Taylor, described by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Wood as alias Domville, was a native of Shropshire, and educated at Oxford, and became a captain in the Parliament forces.

						<p>A committee was appointed in September, 1660, to consider the subject of the King’s revenue, and they “reported to the Commons that the average revenue of Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, from 1637 to 1641 inclusive, had been £895,819, and the average expenditure about £1,110,000. At that time prices were lower and the country less burdened with navy and garrisons, among which latter Dunkirk alone now cost more than £100,000 a year. It appeared, therefore, that the least sum to which the King could be expected to ‘conform his expense’ was £1,200,000.” Burnet writes, “It was believed that if two millions had been asked he could have carried it. But he (Clarendon) had no mind to put the King out of the necessity of having recourse to his Parliament.”</p>

					<p>Edward Cocker (whose name has become proverbial) is associated in popular memory with a work in the production of which there is every probability that he had nothing to do.

					<p>Captain (afterwards Sir Robert) Holmes’ expedition to attack the Dutch settlements in Africa eventuated in an important exploit. Holmes suddenly left the coast of Africa, sailed across the Atlantic, and reduced the Dutch settlement of New Netherlands to English rule, under the title of New York. “The short and true state of the matter is this: the country mentioned was part of the province of Virginia, and, as there is no settling an extensive country at once, a few Swedes crept in there, who surrendered the plantations they could not defend to the Dutch, who, having bought the charts and papers of one Hudson, a seaman, who, by the commission from the crown of England, discovered a river, to which he gave his name, conceited they had purchased a province. Sometimes, when we had strength in those parts, they were English subjects; at others, when that strength declined, they were subjects of the United Provinces.

The design is a sort of classical affair, derived in type from the ciborium of the ancient and continental churches; a composition of two Corinthian columns, engaged or disengaged, with a pediment. It occurs very frequently in the London churches, and may be occasionally remarked in country-town churches, especially those restored at the king’s coming in. Anyone who has ever seen the great Prayer Book of 1661, will at once recognize the allusion; and it is a well-known fact that the frontispiece was drawn and engraved for the purpose mentioned above.”</p>

Cromwell gave great attention to the reasons urged, “but walking two or three turns, and pondering with himself, he told Lord Broghill the king would never forgive him the death of his father. His lordship desired him to employ somebody to sound the king in this matter, to see how he would take it, and offered himself to mediate in it for him. But Cromwell would not consent, but again repeated, ‘The king cannot and will not forgive the death of his father;’ and so he left his lordship, who durst not tell him he had already dealt with his majesty in that affair.

					<p>There can be no reasonable cause for doubting this to refer to the famous song, “To all you ladies now at land,” written by Lord Buckhurst (afterwards Earl of Dorset), and the reference has therefore a very distinct literary value, because it proves that the song was not “made the night before the engagement” of June 3rd, 1665, an opinion which was universally held until this passage was printed. There is nothing in the song itself to indicate any particular time when it was written, and it appears that the first to fix the exact period was Prior the poet (who was born in 1664). In the dedication of his poems to Lionel, Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, Prior states that the earl’s father wrote the celebrated sea song “the night before the engagement with the Dutch in 1665.” <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Poets</i>, says, “seldom any splendid story is wholly true,” and adds that Lord Orrery told him that Lord Buckhurst had been a week employed upon it, and only retouched or finished it on the memorable evening. Lord Braybrooke was criticised for supposing that Pepys referred to Buckhurst’s song, and therefore he entered fully into his own defence, summing up as follows: “In the absence of certain evidence, we cannot decide upon the fact; but all accounts agree in representing Buckhurst as having served as a volunteer under the Duke of York, whose <em>first cruise took place in November</em>, 1664. Perhaps, then, the ballad was written at this time, when an action between the two fleets was only delayed by the Dutch retiring to port. Thus Pepys might well have seen the song in January, 1664⁠–⁠65; and it still may have been retouched, and brought out with <i xml:lang="fr">èclat</i> during the excitement consequent upon the victory of June 3rd following. Nor is it, indeed, easy to imagine that anyone ever wrote a ballad when about to take part in a great naval conflict or that, if two songs had been contemporaneously composed on the same subject, with titles so nearly identical, one only should be known to exist.” The song became popular immediately, and has never lost its popularity. An immense number of imitations have appeared, and reference to some of these is made by the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.

					<p>The practice of striking tallies at the Exchequer was a curious survival of an ancient method of keeping accounts. The method adopted is described in Hubert Hall’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Antiquities and Curiosities of the Exchequer</i>, 1891. The following account of the use of tallies, so frequently alluded to in the Diary, was supplied by Lord Braybrooke. Formerly accounts were kept, and large sums of money paid and received, by the King’s Exchequer, with little other form than the exchange or delivery of tallies, pieces of wood notched or scored, corresponding blocks being kept by the parties to the account; and from this usage one of the head officers of the Exchequer was called the tallier, or teller. These tallies were often negotiable; Adam Smith, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Wealth of Nations</i>, book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>, <abbr>ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xi</span>, says that “in 1696 tallies had been at forty, and fifty, and sixty percent discount, and banknotes at twenty percent.” The system of tallies was discontinued in 1824; and the destruction of the old Houses of Parliament, in the night of October 16th, 1834, is thought to have been occasioned by the overheating of the flues, when the furnaces were employed to consume the tallies rendered useless by the alteration in the mode of keeping the Exchequer accounts. <a href="chapter-63.xhtml#noteref-2455" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Although the two Mays are so frequently mentioned in these pages, and by almost every contemporary annalist, no authentic account of their parentage has been traced; nor is it clear whether they were brothers, or in any way related. There is, however, a strong presumption that they sprung from a family of the same name, seated at Rawmere, in Sussex, one of whom, Jeffrey May, acquired property at Sutton Cheynell, in Leicestershire, in 1574, which was sold by the representatives of Baptist May, in 1712, under an Act passed for the payment of his debts. But though Nichols (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Leicestershire</i>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iv</span>, <abbr>pt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 548) gives a detailed pedigree of the Mays, he could not ascertain whose son Baptist May was, who held the office of Privy Purse to Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>; and he does not even allude to Hugh May. It is stated in Collins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Peerage</i>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 560, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1741, that during their flight after the battle of Worcester, James, Duke of York, delivered his George, which had been a present from the queen his mother, to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hugh May, who preserved it through all difficulties, and afterwards returned it to his royal highness in Holland. Soon after 1662 Hugh May was established as an architect, and employed at Windsor, and in erecting stables at Cornbury, and in building Berkeley House, Piccadilly, and Cassiobury (Evelyn’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>). He also held a place under Sir John Denham, the Surveyor of the Works, whom he expected to succeed; but the office becoming vacant, by the knight’s death in 1667, was given to Sir Christopher Wren, and May was promised an annuity of £300 out of the Works, to make up for his disappointment. Whatever may have been his professional merits, he is not even named in Horace Walpole’s list of architects; and we know nothing more of his career, except that in 1683 he was busy in building a house at Chiswick for Sir Stephen Fox. Baptist May’s history is soon told: He was born about 1627, and after the Restoration belonged to the Duke of York’s household; but he was promoted by the king to the office of Keeper of the Privy Purse, and became the confidant of Charles’s amours. He was also made a Page of the Bedchamber, which place he lost, having contrived to offend his royal master. In 1689⁠–⁠90 we find him returned at the general election as burgess for Windsor, with Sir Christopher Wren; they were, however, both unseated by petition. Baptist died May 2nd, 1693, and lies buried in <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s Chapel, where the slab inscribed to his memory is still to be seen. <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite></p>

Her discourse was much with the great men and ladies of France in praise of the people and of the country; of their courage, generosity, good nature; and would excuse all their miscarriages in relation to unfortunate effects of the late war, as if it were a convulsion of some desperate and infatuated persons, rather than from the genius and temper of the kingdom” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> Cartwright, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 43, 45). <a href="chapter-66.xhtml#noteref-2563" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>A news letter of August 19th (Salisbury), gives the following account of this affair:⁠—“The Earl of Sandwich being on the Norway coast, ordered Sir Thomas Teddeman with 20 ships to attack 50 Dutch merchant ships in Bergen harbour; six convoyers had so placed themselves that only four or five of the ships could be reached at once. The Governor of Bergen fired on our ships, and placed 100 pieces of ordnance and two regiments of foot on the rocks to attack them, but they got clear without the loss of a ship, only 500 men killed or wounded, five or six captains among them. The fleet has gone to Sole Bay to repair losses and be ready to encounter the Dutch fleet, which is gone northward” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Calendar of State Papers</i>, 1664⁠–⁠65, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 526, 527). Medals were struck in Holland, the inscription in Dutch on one of these is thus translated: “Thus we arrest the pride of the English, who extend their piracy even against their friends, and who insulting the forts of Norway, violate the rights of the harbours of King Frederick; but, for the reward of their audacity, see their vessels destroyed by the balls of the Dutch” (Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Medallic Illustrations of the History of Great Britain and Ireland</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> Franks and Grueber, 1885, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 508). Sir Gilbert Talbot’s “True Narrative of the Earl of Sandwich’s Attempt upon Bergen with the English Fleet on the 3rd of August, 1665, and the Cause of his Miscarriage thereupon,” is in the British Museum (<abbr>Harl.</abbr> <abbr>MS.</abbr>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 6859).

Sir John Denham, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Advice to a Painter</i>, gives a long satirical account of the affair. A coloured drawing of the attack upon Bergen, on vellum, showing the range of the ships engaged, is in the British Museum. Shortly after the Bergen affair forty of the Dutch merchant vessels, on their way to Holland, fell into the hands of the English, and in Penn’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memorials of Sir William Penn</i>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 364, is a list of the prizes taken on the 3rd and 4th September. The troubles connected with these prizes and the disgrace into which Lord Sandwich fell are fully set forth in subsequent pages of the Diary. Evelyn writes in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i> (November 27th, 1665): “There was no small suspicion of my Lord Sandwich having permitted diverse commanders who were at y<sup>e</sup> taking of y<sup>e</sup> East India prizes to break bulk and take to themselves jewels, silkes, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, tho’ I believe some whom I could name fill’d their pockets, my <abbr>Lo.</abbr> Sandwich himself had the least share.

It was thought, that one of the instructions Madame [Henrietta, Duchess of Orleans] brought along with her, was to laugh us out of these vests; which she performed so effectually, that in a moment, like so many footmen who had quitted their master’s livery, we all took it again, and returned to our old service; so that the very time of doing it gave a very critical advantage to France, since it looked like an evidence of our returning to her interest, as well as to their fashion.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Character of a Trimmer</i> (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Miscellanies by the Marquis of Halifax</i>, 1704, <abbr>p.</abbr> 164).

The Tower was accordingly viewed, and its surprise ordered by boats over the moat, and from thence to scale the wall. One Alexander, not yet taken, had likewise distributed money to these conspirators; and, for the carrying on the design more effectually, they were told of a Council of the great ones that sat frequently in London, from whom issued all orders; which Council received their directions from another in Holland, who sat with the States; and that <em>the third of September</em> was pitched on for the attempt, as being found by Lilly’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Almanac</i>, and a scheme erected for that purpose, to be a lucky day, a planet then ruling which prognosticated the downfall of Monarchy.

If I may use his own words, it was a pagan and abandoned way he had sometime pursu’d, scepticism itself not excepted.⁠ ⁠… He had for many years practis’d in the politicks of this nation, and having so nearly attacht himself to one of the greatest Ministers of State [Lord Chancellor Clarendon] that this kingdom ever knew (whose mistaken wisdom and integrity perhaps hath been since better understood by the want of him), made himself no small figure in the administration.”</p>

Because, as he saith, that there is so much gold now bestowed about the garnishing of the pieces of the Cross, that there is none left for poore folke. Is not this a high reason? As though all the gold that is now bestowed about the pieces of the Holy Cross would not have failed to have been given to poor men, if they had not been bestowed about the garnishing of the Cross! and as though there were nothing lost, but what is bestowed about Christ’s Cross! Wolsey, says Cavendish, on his fall, gave to Norris, who brought him a ring of gold as a token of good will from Henry, “a little chaine of gold, made like a bottle chain, with a cross of gold, wherein was a piece of the Holy Cross, which he continually wore about his neck, next his body; and said, furthermore, ‘Master Norris, I assure you, when I was in prosperity, although it seem but small in value, yet I would not gladly have departed with the same for a thousand pounds.’ ” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1852, <abbr>p.</abbr> 167.

He confessed he had begun the fire, and persisted in his confession to his death, for he was hanged upon no other evidence but that of his own confession. It is true he gave so broken an account of the whole matter that he was thought mad. Yet he was blindfolded, and carried to several places of the city, and then his eyes being opened, he was asked if that was the place, and he being carried to wrong places, after he looked round about for some time, he said that was not the place, but when he was brought to the place where it first broke out, he affirmed that was the true place.”</p>

					<p>The practice of giving alms on Maundy Thursday to poor men and women equal in number to the years of the sovereign’s age is a curious survival in an altered form of an old custom. The original custom was for the king to wash the feet of twelve poor persons, and to give them a supper in imitation of Christ’s last supper and his washing of the Apostles’ feet. James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> was the last sovereign to perform the ceremony in person, but it was performed by deputy so late as 1731. The Archbishop of York was the king’s deputy on that occasion. The institution has passed through the various stages of feet washing with a supper, the discontinuance of the feet washing, the substitution of a gift of provisions for the supper, and finally the substitution of a gift of money for the provisions. The ceremony took place at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall; but it is now held at Westminster Abbey. Maundy is derived from the Latin word <i xml:lang="la">maudatum</i>, which commences the original anthem sung during the ceremony, in reference to Christ’s command; but Spelman supposed it to be connected with the maunds or baskets to contain the gifts⁠—as will be seen from what has been said of the original institution, this is an impossible explanation. Professor Skeat has settled the question conclusively by proving beyond doubt that Maundy is really the French <i xml:lang="fr">mandé</i>, which is the regular phonetic forin of Latin <i xml:lang="la">mandatum</i>, a command (see his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Etymological Dictionary</i> and note to “Piers Plowman,” <abbr>E. E.</abbr> Text <abbr>Soc.</abbr> edition, part <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iv</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 379).

					<p>This play was entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Sawney the Scot, or the Taming of a Shrew</i>, and consisted of an alteration of Shakespeare’s play by John Lacy.

In the old <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Taming of a Shrew</i> (1594), reprinted by Thomas Amyot for the Shakespeare Society in 1844, the hero’s servant is named Sander, and this seems to have given the hint to Lacy, when altering Shakespeare’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Taming of <em>the</em> Shrew</i>, to foist a Scotsman into the action.

						<p>“One unpopular act of his [Clarendon] is not to be forgot, because it had a great influence in a short time, and this was the building a very stately large house by the <em>Park</em>, called <em>Clarendon House</em>, which, in a little time, obtained the name of <em>Dunkirk House</em>, as though it had been built by the money taken for the sale of that place. This house was built in the Chancellor’s absence in the plague year, principally at the charge of the Vintners’ Company, who, designing to monopolize his favour, made it abundantly more large and magnificent than ever he intended or desired. And I have been assured by an unquestionable hand, that when he came to see the case of that house, he rather submitted than consented, and, with a sigh, said, ‘This house will one day be my ruin.’ ”</p>

					<p>Gilbert Sheldon. It is difficult to deal in a short note with such an infamous charge as this.

					<p>The “boot” was originally a projection on each side of the coach, where the passengers sat with their backs to the carriage. Such a “boot” is seen in the carriage containing the attendants of Queen Elizabeth, in Hoefnagel’s well-known picture of Nonsuch Palace, dated 1582. Taylor, the Water Poet, the inveterate opponent of the introduction of coaches, thus satirizes the one in which he was forced to take his place as a passenger: “It wears two boots and no spurs, sometimes having two pairs of legs in one boot; and oftentimes against nature most preposterously it makes fair ladies wear the boot. Moreover, it makes people imitate sea-crabs, in being drawn sideways, as they are when they sit in the boot of the coach.” In course of time these projections were abolished, and the coach then consisted of three parts, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, the body, the boot (on the top of which the coachman sat), and the baskets at the back. <a href="chapter-92.xhtml#noteref-3596" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The coins were chiefly half-crowns of Elizabeth and the two elder Stuarts, and all of a date anterior to the Restoration.

					<p>In 1652 General Monk was married, at the Church of <abbr>St.</abbr> George, Southwark, to Anne, daughter of his regimental farrier, John Clarges, and in the following year had by her a son, Christopher, the “Earl of Torrington” here mentioned. The child was suckled by Honour Mills, a vendor of apples and oysters, and succeeded his father as Duke of Albemarle in 1670; but dying in 1688, <abbr>s. p.</abbr>, all the honours and titles of the family became extinct. It came out, on a trial of trespass between William Sherwen, plaintiff, and Sir Walter Clarges, <abbr>Bart.</abbr>, and others, defendants, at the bar of the King’s Bench, November 15th, 1702, that Anne Clarges had married for her first husband Thomas Ratford, in 1632, and was separated from him in 1649; but no certificate of his death had ever appeared. This fact would invalidate the legitimacy of the Earl of Torrington, and the suspicion is strengthened by the low origin and vulgar habits of the duchess, and the threats which she resorted to, to prevent the story being made public. One Pride, who, as the son of a daughter of an elder brother of George, Duke of Albemarle, claimed to be heir to Duke George, brought an ejectment against the Earl of Bath (who claimed under a deed from Duke Christopher) in the King’s Bench, in Hilary Term, 6 William <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, attempting to bastardize Duke Christopher, on the ground mentioned in the note.

						<p>“The five ministers of the king whose names were appended to the Treaty of Alliance with France for war against Holland, which was ultimately published Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale⁠—have come down to posterity with the nickname of the Cabal Ministry, from the accident that the initials of their names make the word <em>Cabal</em>. This word <em>cabal</em> had not at that time the unfavourable meaning which now always attaches to it. It was used to designate any political combination, and is so used in a passage⁠ ⁠… from a letter of Andrew Marvel, in which he speaks of Buckingham’s ‘Cabal,’ and of Arlington’s rival ‘cabal’ in the same ministry. It was indeed in use as a name for the small Committee of the Privy Council otherwise called the Committee for Foreign Affairs, which had the chief management of the course of government, and here it had much the meaning of the word cabinet now in vogue.”</p>

Having lost his own fortune in the prosecution of his claims, he remained in gaol till taken out by James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> to be made Chancellor of Ireland (under which character Hume first notices him), was knighted, and subsequently created Lord Gawsworth after the abdication of James, sat in his parliament in Dublin in 1689, and then is supposed to have accompanied his fallen master to France. Whether the conduct of Fitton was met, as he alleges, by similar guilt on the part of Lord Gerard, God only can judge; but his hand fell heavily on the representatives of that noble house. In less than half a century the husbands of its two co-heiresses, James, Duke of Hamilton, and Charles, Lord Mohun, were slain by each other’s hands in a murderous duel arising out of a dispute relative to the partition of the Fitton estates, and Gawsworth itself passed to an unlineal hand, by a series of alienations complicated beyond example in the annals of this country.” <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <a href="chapter-98.xhtml#noteref-3907" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

And shortlie after, came Sir Anthonie Kingston to the miller’s house, and calling for the miller, the servant came forth, and answered that he was the miller. ‘How long,’ quoth Sir Anthonie, ‘hast thou kept this mill?’ He answered, ‘Three years.’⁠—‘Well, then,’ said he, ‘come on: thou must go with me;’ and caused his men to laie hands on him, and to bring him to the next tree, saieing to him, ‘Thou hast been a busie knave, and therefore here shalt thou hang.’ Then cried the fellow out, and saide that he was not the miller, but the miller’s man. ‘Well, then,’ said Sir Anthonie, ‘thou art a false knave to be in two tales: therefore,’ said he, ‘hang him up;’ and so incontinentlie hanged he was indeed. After he was dead, one that was present told Sir Anthonie, ‘Surelie, sir, this was but the miller’s man.’⁠—‘What then!’ said he, ‘could he ever have done his maister better service than to hang for him?’ ” <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <a href="chapter-100.xhtml#noteref-4000" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

In the sea-fight off Southwold Bay on June 3rd, 1665, the English triumphed over the Dutch, but the very considerable victory was not followed up. During the night, while the Duke of York slept, Henry Brouncker, his groom of the bedchamber, ordered the lieutenant to shorten sail, by which means the progress of the whole fleet was retarded, the Duke of York’s being the leading ship. The duke affirmed that he first heard of Brouncker’s unjustifiable action in July, and yet he kept the culprit in his service for nearly two years after the offence had come to his knowledge. After Brouncker had been dismissed from the duke’s service, the House of Commons ejected him. The whole matter is one of the unsolved difficulties of history.

					<p>John Middleton, the remarkable person here alluded to, known by the name of “The Child of Hale,” was born in 1578, and buried in the churchyard of Hale, in Lancashire, in 1623, where his gravestone is still to be seen. About the year 1617 Sir Gilbert Ireland took him up to the court of James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, when he threw the king’s wrestler, and put out his thumb, by which feat he disobliged the courtiers, and was sent back, with a present of £20 from the sovereign. He returned home by Brazenose College, then full of Lancashire students, and his picture was taken, and is still preserved there. Likenesses of this English giant are also extant at High Legh, at Knowsley, and at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ireland Blackburne’s seat, at Hale. “Middleton’s hand,” observes Plot (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Staffordshire</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 295), “measured, from the carpus to the end of his middle finger, seventeen inches, his palm was eight inches and a half broad, and his whole height nine feet three inches, wanting but six inches of the height of Goliath, if the portrait of him in Brazenose Library, drawn at length, as it is said, in his just proportion, be a true piece of him.” These dimensions appear to have been compared with the portrait at Hale, with which they exactly accorded, as did the shape of the giant’s hand cut upon a stone in the college cellar, with the date affixed, to which Pepys alludes. The blank in the Diary, after the word Hales, was obviously left for the dimensions of the hand. <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">B.</abbr></cite> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Falconer Madan, Assistant Librarian of the Bodleian, has kindly given the editor the following particulars, which supplement Lord Braybrooke’s note.

There is also in the Buttery a picture of the hand of the man full size, and till the last ten years there was an outline of a hand on a gilt background on the eastern one of the two doorposts of the cellar door under the hall on the south side of the latter, at the foot of a flight of stone steps. <a href="chapter-102.xhtml#noteref-4086" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>During the troubled reign of Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, the House of Commons gave parishioners the right of appointing lecturers at the various churches without the consent of rector or vicar, and this naturally gave rise to many quarrels.

The late <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wornum, the biographer of Holbein, wrote, “There can be no question of the genuineness of the picture in its foundation,” but he was “disposed to believe that Holbein never did finish it;” whilst, from the great inferiority of the second series of heads on the left of the king, in which there is no trace of Holbein’s hand, he considered that “these must have been added later.” We are not told whether the company named any price, even if our journalist had been inclined to the speculation.

						<p>“The chief end in printing these sermons, was, first, to show the difference between the University and City breeding up of preachers, and to let the people know that any one that hath been bred a scholar is able to preach any way to the capacity and content of an auditory. And, secondly, that none can do this, but they only that have had such education: yet, notwithstanding, ordinary capacities are more taken with cloak and laymen’s preaching than that of the gown.”</p>

					<p>Charles Porter “was the son of a prebend[ary] in Norwich, and a ’prentice boy in the city in the rebellious times. When the committee house was blown up, he was very active in that rising, and after the soldiers came and dispersed the rout, he, as a rat among joint stools, shifted to and fro among the shambles, and had forty pistols shot at him by the troopers that rode after him to kill him [24th April, 1648]. In that distress he had the presence of mind to catch up a little child that, during the rout, was frighted, and stood crying in the streets, and, unobserved by the troopers, ran away with it. The people opened a way for him, saying, ‘Make room for the poor child.’ Thus he got off, and while search was made for him in the marketplace, got into the Yarmouth ferry, and at Yarmouth took ship and went to Holland.⁠ ⁠… In Holland he trailed a pike, and was in several actions as a common soldier. At length he kept a cavalier eating-house; but, his customers being needy, he soon broke, and came for England, and being a genteel youth, was taken in among the chancery clerks, and got to be under a master.⁠ ⁠… His industry was great; and he had an acquired dexterity and skill in the forms of the court; and although he was a bon companion, and followed much the bottle, yet he made such dispatches as satisfied his clients, especially the clerks, who knew where to find him. His person was florid, and speech prompt and articulate. But his vices, in the way of women and the bottle, were so ungoverned, as brought him to a morsel.⁠ ⁠… When the Lord Keeper North had the Seal, who from an early acquaintance had a kindness for him which was well known, and also that he was well heard, as they call it, business flowed in to him very fast, and yet he could scarce keep himself at liberty to follow his business.⁠ ⁠… At the Revolution, when his interest fell from, and his debts began to fall upon him, he was at his wits’ end.⁠ ⁠… His character for fidelity, loyalty, and facetious conversation was without exception”⁠—Roger North’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Norths</i> (Lord Keeper Guilford), <abbr>ed.</abbr> Jessopp, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 381⁠–⁠2. He was originally made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in the reign of James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, during the viceroyalty of Lord Clarendon, 1686, when he was knighted. “He was,” says Burnet, “a man of ready wit, and being poor was thought a person fit to be made a tool of. When Clarendon was recalled, Porter was also displaced, and Fitton was made chancellor, a man who knew no other law than the king’s pleasure” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Own Time</i>). Sir Charles Porter was again made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1690, and in this same year he acted as one of the Lords Justices.

Whilst he was in England in 1669 the prince caused a number of views of places and of scenery to be executed for him. Thirty-nine of these have been engraved on a reduced scale for Mawman’s quarto volume of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cosmo’s Travels</i>, published in 1821, but those prints being very unsatisfactory, the facsimile copies of the original drawings now at Florence were purchased by the Right <abbr>Hon.</abbr> Thomas Grenville, and form part of the splendid library which he bequeathed in 1846 to the British Museum. Readers will remember the use which Lord Macaulay has made of them, that “scarce a hedgerow is to be seen, and numerous tracts, now rich with cultivation, appear as bare as Salisbury Plain.” Sir John Reresby writes:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“April, 1669. The Prince of Tuscany came to London with a retinue and equipage suitable to his quality. The king entertained him magnificently; after some time he kept house at his own charge, where he had all the portable varieties for food and drink Italy could afford. I dined twice with him; he was very kind to me, as he was to all those that had travelled in Italy and knew the language.”</p>

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Biddulph Martin, in his interesting work on “The Grasshopper in Lombard Street,” 1892, refers to Alderman Backwell’s building operations. He writes (<abbr>p.</abbr> 185): “Shortly previous to the Great Fire, Backwell, whose shop was at the Unicorn in Lombard Street, next door to the Grasshopper, conceived the idea of developing the considerable block of property over which he had acquired an interest by opening passages through it from Lombard Street to Cornhill.” Again (<abbr>p.</abbr> 186): “Backwell possibly took advantage of the catastrophe of the fire to enlarge his views,” and then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Martin quotes the passage in the text. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Martin writes: “Alderman Backwell figures largely in the City history of his time, and was certainly eminent among the goldsmiths of the Restoration; but it seems that the ‘little town’ whose erection he contemplated was built on land in which he had a leasehold interest only. The Great Fire of London destroyed not only the City itself, but also most of its records.

					<p>This island, the second in size and in population of the West India Islands, was discovered by Columbus on December 6th, 1492. He called it Española, or little Spain, whence the latinized name of Hispaniola. It was afterwards also called Santo Domingo, after its chief town. The island remained entirely a Spanish possession till the seventeenth century. By the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 the western portion of the island was definitely ceded to France. The island is now divided into two negro republics; the western, in which French is the official language, is known as the republic of Haiti, and the eastern, in which Spanish is the official language, is known as Santo Domingo. <a href="chapter-113.xhtml#noteref-4533" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Henry Killigrew, son of Thomas Killigrew, talked loudly of his old intimacy with the Countess of Shrewsbury, and this outrage was done at the instigation of that worthless woman. Killigrew appears to have been continually in trouble, for he was beaten by the Duke of Buckingham in 1667, and soon after was in disgrace at Court. Pepys, on May 30th, 1668, mentions that he had newly come back from France, but in October of the same year he was in Paris again, for Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> wrote to his sister, the Duchess of Orleans, on October 17th, respecting him:</p>
